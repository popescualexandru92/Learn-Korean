        """In this lesson, you will learn how to say This, That, Here, and There in Korean.

Please note that you don't need to worry about the Korean sentences you don’t fully understand for now. These example sentences are just to provide enough context so that you understand the usage of “This, That” and “Here, There” in Korean more accurately.

 

    This, That, That (over there) : 이, 그, 저

In English, to refer to a specific person or a noun that is near you, you can use “this person/noun.”

Or, if somebody or something you’re talking about is at a certain distance or is out of your sight, you can use “that person/noun” 

In Korean, it works the same. However, there are two different words you can use to say “that,” which are : 그 (that) and 저 (that over there)”

 

Let’s first learn how to say “this person/noun.”

1) 이 means “this,” and it is a modifier (in other words, it is followed by a noun) and is used when pointing to a specific thing, person, or anything that is not far away from you, and you can even touch it.

Let’s look at some examples:

이 책 –  this book

이 여자 – this girl 

이 차 – this car 

이 아이 – this child

이 남자 – this man

이 티셔츠 – this T-shirt

 

2) 그 is a modifier which means “that,” and it’s used when referring to 1) something that’s out of one’s sight but in one’s mind or 2) something that’s at a closer distance to the listener, not the speaker.

그 차 = that car [it could be, 1) the car that I remember/saw/talked about/liked, 2) the car that is closer to the listener, but not to the speaker]

Let’s compare «이» and «그»:

이 책 – this book (you’re talking about the book that is within your sight/touch)

그 책 – that book (you’re talking about the book that you have in mind, or the book that is close to the listener)

e.g.

(앞에 있는 책을 가리키며) 저는 이 책을 읽고 싶어요. (pointing to a book in front of you) I want to read this book.

어제 산 책 기억나요? 그 책이 없어졌어요. Do you remember the book that I bought yesterday? That book is missing.

이 차가 검정색이에요. – This car (near me) is black.

그 차가 검정색이에요. – That car (that we talked about earlier) is black.

                                    – That car (that is near you, but not me) is black.

 

Let’s look at more examples:

그 영화 재미있었어요! – That movie was fun! (the movie that I watched earlier)

그 선생님은 착한 분이에요. – That teacher is a nice person. (the teacher that I know but is not here right now)

그 수업은 재미없었어요. – That class was boring. (the class that I took earlier)

그 여자가 행복해 보여요. – That woman looks happy. (that woman I remember, or that woman that’s near the listener)

그 아기가 울고 있어요. – That baby is crying. (that baby I remember, or that baby that’s near the listener)

 

3) 저 is used when talking about something/someone that is at a certain distance from both you and the person you’re talking to, and it usually translates to “over there”.

이 여자는 제 오빠의 여자친구예요. – This girl is my brother’s girlfriend (you’re talking about a girl, that is near you)

그 여자는 제 오빠의 여자친구예요. – That girl is my brother’s girlfriend (you’re talking about the girl that is near the listener, or the girl that isn’t here right now)

저 여자는 제 오빠의 여자친구예요. – That girl (over there) is my brother’s girlfriend (you’re talking about the girl who is at a certain distance from both you and the listener).

Let’s look at more examples:

저 사람은 의사로 일해요. – That person (over there) works as a doctor.

저 곳은 아름다워요! – That place (over there) is beautiful!

우리 저 카페에 같이 갈래요? – Shall we go to that coffee shop?

 

    This thing / That thing / That thing over there : 이것(=이거) /  그것(=그거)  / 저것(=저거)

“것” and “거” mean “thing”. Both of them mean the same thing, but “거” is used more often in spoken form. 

To say “this” or “that” as in “this thing” or “that thing” (noun, not a modifier,) you need to combine 이(this), 그(that) or 저(that) with 것 or 거.

이것 / 이거 = this (as in this thing)

그것  / 그거 = that (as in that thing)

저것 / 저거 = that (as in that thing over there)

e.g.

이거 드세요. Eat this.

그거 샀어요? Did you buy that thing (that we talked about)?

저거 어때요? How is that thing (over there)?

 

    Here, There and Over There: 여기, 거기, 저기

여기, 거기 and 저기 are the words that refer to a certain place, and they are the place equivalents of 이거, 그거, and 저거.

여기:  here, this place

거기: there, that place > 1) the place that is far from the speaker but close to the listener, or 2) the place that is out of their sight but in their mind. 

저기: over there, that place over there > means that the place is far from both the listener and the speaker.

여기 예뻐요. This place is beautiful.

거기 좋아요? Do you like that place? / Do you like it there?

저기로 갈까요? Shall we go over there? 

 

[Quick Summary]

이 : this (modifier)

그 : that (modifier)

저 : that over there (modifier)

 

이것 / 이거 : this (noun)

그것 / 그거 : that (noun)

저것 / 저거 : that over there (noun)

 

여기 : here (this place)

거기 : there (that place)

저기 : over there (that place over there)""",

    title: "Lesson 10. Korean Numbers (Sino & Pure)",
    category: "B0",
    text:
        """There are two types of numbers in Korean – Sino and Pure (or Native.) 

Sino numbers are of Chinese origin, and pure numbers are based on native Korean.

They are used in different situations; Sino is used when counting floors, date, money, length, height, weight, etc., and Pure numbers are used when counting age, the number of people or things, etc.

In this lesson, we will focus on learning the numbers.

 

First, let’s start with Sino Korean numbers.

1 – 일 [il]

2 – 이 [ee]

3 – 삼 [sam]

4 – 사 [sa]

5 – 오 [o]

6 – 육 [yook]

7 – 칠 [chil]

8 – 팔 [pal]

9 – 구 [goo]

10 – 십 [shib]

These are the basic numbers that allow you to form bigger ones when combining them.

 

To form numbers from 11 to 19, you have to put 십 (10) first and then another number from 1 to 9, for example:

11 – 십일 [shib-il]

As you can see, it’s basically a combination of “10 + 1”.

12 – 십이 [sib-ee]

13 – 십삼 [shib-sam]

14 – 십사 [shib-sa]

15 – 십오 [shib-o]

16 – 십육 [shib-yook]

17 – 십칠 [shib-chil]

18 – 십팔 [shib-pal]

19 – 십구 [shib-goo]

 

If you want to say 20, you have to say “2х10”.

20 – 이십 [ee-shib]

21 – 이십일 [ee-shib-il]

22 – 이십이 [ee-shib-ee]

23 – 이십삼 [ee-shib-sam]

24 – 이십사 [ee-shib-sa]

25 – 이십오 [ee-shib-o]

26 – 이십육 [ee-shib-yook]

27 – 이십칠 [ee-shib-chil]

28 – 이십팔 [ee-shib-pal]

29 – 이십구 [ee-shib-goo]

 

The same pattern applies to the following numbers.

30 – 삼십 [sam-shib]

31 – 삼십일 [sam-shib-ol]

32 – 삼십일 [sam-shib-il]

32 – 삼십이 [sam-shib-ee]

900 – 구백 [goo-baek]

999 – 구백구십구 [goo-baek-goo-shib-goo]

…and so on.

 

Now, let’s learn how to form four-figure numbers.

1000 – 천 [chun]

1001 – 천일 [chun-il]

1096 – 천구십오 [chun-goo-shib-o]

1403 – 천삼백삼 [chun-sam-baek-sam]

3000 – 삼천 [sam-chun]

4000 – 사천 [sa-chun]

5000 – 오천 [o-chun]

6000 – 육천 [yook-chun]

7000 – 칠천 [chil-chun]

8000 – 팔천 [pal-chun]

9000 – 구천 [goo-chun]

2019 – 이천십구 [ee-chun-shib-goo]

3456 – 삼천사백오십육 [sam-chun-sa-baek-o-shib-yook]

9876 – 구천팔백칠십육 [goo-chun-pal-baek-chil-shib-yook]

10000 – 만 [mahn]

40000 – 사만 [sa-mahn]

50000 – 오만 [o-mahn]

60000 – 육만 [yook-mahn]

70000 – 칠만 [chil-man]

80000 – 팔만 [pal-mahn]

90000 – 구만 [goo-mahn]

52391 – 오만 이천 삼백 구십 일 [o-mahn-ee-chun-sam-baek-goo-shib-il]

86400 – 팔만 육천 사백 [pal-mahn-yook-chun-sa-baek]

100000 – 십만 [shib-man]

110000 – 십일만 [shib-il-mahn]

120000 – 십이만 [shib-ee-mahn]

130000 – 십삼만 [shib-sam-mahn]

140000 – 십사만 [shib-sa-mahn]

150000 – 십오만 [shib-o-mahn]

160000 – 십육만 [shib-yook-mahn]

170000 – 십칠만 [shib-chil-mahn]

180000 – 십팔만 [shib-pal-mahn]

190000 – 십구만 [shib-goo-mahn]

999999 – 구십구만구천구백구십구 [goo-shib-goo-mahn-goo-chun-goo-baek-goo-shib-goo]

1000000 – 백만 [baek-mahn]

 

Now, let’s look at Pure Korean numbers.

There are not that many numbers, because only the numbers from 1 to 99 have Pure names.

1 – 하나 [hana]

2 – 둘 [dool]

3 – 셋 [set]

4 – 넷 [net]

5 – 다섯 [da-sut]

6 – 여섯 [yuh-sut]

7 – 일곱 [il-gob]

8 – 여덟 [yuh-dul]

9 – 아홉 [a-hop]

10 – 열 [yeol]

 

Unlike Sino names like 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90, each of these numbers has its own unique name in Pure names.

20 – 스물 [seu-mool]

30 – 서른 [suh-leun]

40 – 마흔 [ma-heun]

50 – 쉰 [shwin]

60 – 예순 [ye-soon]

70 – 일흔 [il-heun]

80 – 여든 [yuh-deun]

90 – 아흔 [a-heun] 

If you know these numbers, you can easily form others. The principle is the same as with Sino numbers.

11 – 열하나 [yeol-hana]

12 – 열둘 [yeol-dool]

13 – 열셋 [yeol-set]

14 – 열넷 [yeol-net]

15 – 열다섯 [yeol-daseot]

16 – 열여섯 [yeol-yeosut]

17 – 열일곱 [yeol-ilgob]

18 – 열여덟 [yeol-yeodel]

19 – 열아홉 [yeol-ahob]

20 – 스물 [seu-mool]

21 – 스물하나 [seumool-hana]

…and so on.

32 – 서른 둘 [seoreun-dool]

45 – 마흔다섯 [maheun-dasut]

53 – 쉰셋 [shwin-set]

66 – 예순여섯 [yesoon-yeosut]

77 – 일흔일곱 [ilheun-ilgob]

88 – 여든여덜 [yeodeun-yeodul]

99 – 아흔아홉 [aheun-ahob]

 

And finally, let’s learn how to say “zero”.

Sino: 0 – 영 [young]

Pure: 0 – 공 [gong] or 빵 [bbang]""",

  Lesson(
      title: "Lesson 2. Subject Particles : 은/는 & 이/가",
      category: "B1",
      text:
          """Subject Particles: These are the particles that mark the subjects of a sentence.  

There are 2 types: 
 	Topic marking particles 	Subject marking particles  
Preceding noun with 받침 	은  (e.g. 이것은) 	이 (e.g. 이것이*)    
Preceding noun without 받침 	는 (e.g. 저는) 	가 (e.g. 제가**) 

 

*Note: When 이거 is combined with either 이/가 particle, it can be abbreviated to 이게. This is more common, especially in spoken Korean. The same applies to 저거/그거 forming 저게/그게. e.g., 이것이/이거가 연필이에요 = 이게 연필이에요- This is a pencil  

 

**Note: When 가 is used as a particle with 저, its form changes to 제 and thus forms 제가 

The same applies to 나 which becomes 내가 and 너which becomes 네가 (pronounced as 니가) 

 

Example sentences 

I am a student. – 제가 학생이에요. (존댓말) 

My dad works every day. – 아빠는 매일 일해요. (존댓말) 

The teacher likes Korean food. – 그 선생님이 한국 음식을 좋아해요. (존댓말) 

I am a beautiful lady. – 내가 미인이야. (반말) 

 

Usages and differences 

There are 2 basic usages to know: Centre vs Non-centre and General noun vs Specific noun 

 

1) Centre vs Non-centre: 

The noun which acts as the focus of the sentence is attached to 은/는.  

The noun which isn’t necessarily the focus of the sentence is attached to 이/가. 

– This is why 은/는 can be referred to as the TOPIC marking particle since it highlights the topic that the sentence is focused on  

 

은/는 Examples: 

제 이름은 은지예요. – My name is Eunji. 

저는 의사예요. – I am a doctor. 

저는 서울에 살아요. – I live in Seoul.  

저는 한국 드라마를 매일 봐요. – I watch Korean drama every day. 

저희 아빠는 병원에서 일하세요. – My dad works at a hospital. 

저희 가족은 행복해요. – My family is happy.

한국은 아시아에 있는 나라입니다. – Korea is a country in Asia. 

이/가 Examples: 

A: 부산에 또 놀러 와. – Come visit Busan again. 

B: 제가 서울에 살아요. 그래서 자주 못 와요 – I live in Seoul, so I can’t come often. 

 

The phrase “I live in Seoul” is not used as general information but rather as an explanation/reason for the follow-up sentence. Therefore, the focus is more on the fact that you live in Seoul instead of the fact that you live in Seoul. In this way, 이/가 would be more natural to use.  

 

It is however possible to say 저는 서울에 살아요 but since this shifts focus onto you, it may come across arrogant depending on tone (this is more of a feeling/nuance that your sentence develops more than you seeming outwardly narcissistic) 

 

A: 왜 울고 있어요? – Why are you crying? 

B: 고양이가 다쳤어요. – My cat got hurt. 

 

이/가 is used since the focus is on why you are crying and not the cat itself.  

In this context, 이/가 can also be used to specify my cat versus a cat in general (more on this later.) 

 

A: 서울에 사는* 사람 알아요? – Do you know anyone who lives in Seoul? 

B: 은지가 서울에 살아요 – Eunji lives in Seoul

*this ‘는’ is not a subject marker; it belongs to a different grammar called “verb’s modifier form” which we’ll learn later.

 

Again, the focus is on who lives in Seoul rather than Eunji herself.  

 

제프가 노래를 못하네 – Jeff is a bad singer 

Here, it is not necessary to put emphasis on who Jeff is since it may already be obvious by context (e.g., Jeff is the only one on stage at a concert) and so 이/가 can be used. In this way, focus is more on the fact that he is “a bad singer” rather than on pointing him out. 

 

제프는 노래를 못하네 – Jeff is a bad singer 

 

Contrasting the above example, this phrase could be natural in a context where you want to highlight Jeff. For example, Jeff is now part of a band onstage.  

 

2) Noun is General vs Specific:  

은/는is used when the noun is something general or you’re giving universal facts about it.  

이/가is used when the noun is specific or you’re referring to the noun in a specific situation, example or circumstance.  

 

Example sentences:  

 

아기는 울어요 – Babies cry – a general, universal fact about babies 

아기가*** 울어요 – The baby cries – a specific baby in a specific time/circumstance 

 

***This can be made more specific by adding modifiers such as 이/저/지수의/어떤, but often the 이/가 particle is enough to highlight the specific baby that you are referring to  

 
고양이는 생선을 먹어요 – Cats eat fish – a general, universal fact 

고양이가 생선을 먹어요 – The cat eats fish – a specific cat in a specific time/circumstance 

 

NB: In both of these examples, 이 아기는 울어요/ 이 고양이는 생선을 먹어요are probably uncommon sentences since the information you are giving are general facts about all babies/cats and so wouldn’t often give someone this information about a specific baby/cat.  

However, if the information you are giving about the general behaviours/actions of a baby/cat is specific to this baby/cat, then this would become natural. For example, 이 고양이는 가끔 생선을 먹어요 (“This cat sometimes eats fish”) or 이 아기는 매일 울어요 (“This baby cries everyday”) could be natural since these general behaviors are specific to the baby/cat in question.  

 

친구는 도와줘요 – Friends help  – a general, universal fact 

친구가 도와줘요 – A (specific) friend helps.

해는 동쪽에서 떠요 – the Sun rises in the East – general fact  

NB: 해가 서쪽에서 떴나 봐요 (“The Sun must’ve risen in the West”) is an idiomatic expression that shows that something very out of the ordinary has happened. For example, someone who normally wakes up very late, suddenly wakes up at 6am. Here, 이/가 particle is used since this is not a general property of the sun but rather specific to the sun of that day.  

 

3) When both 은/는 and 이/가 are used in one sentence  

 

Some sentences can have both particles within it. As per the rules above, the different particles are used to either highlight the focus of each sentence or to show whether information is general or specific to a noun. 

 

 

 

 

More examples: 

 

지수는 성격이 좋아요 – Jisoo has a nice personality (lit. as for Jisoo, her personality is good) 

이 집은 사과가 비싸요 – Apples in this store are pricey/expensive.  

첫 인상은 중요해요 – First impressions are important. 

인터뷰에서는**** 첫 인상이 중요해요 – In an interview, first impression is important.  

****Note: 은/는 can not only be placed after nouns but also after other particles such as 에서 and 에 etc. This is NOT the case for 이/가 particle.  

 

OVERALL USAGES (SUMMARY)

 
Topic marking particle: 은/는 	Subject marking particle: 이/가 
When the subject is the focus/topic of the sentence  	When the subject is NOT the focus/topic of the sentence  
Giving general, universal information about a noun 	

When the noun is specific or you are referring to the noun in a specific situation, example or circumstance 

 

 

If the noun is already specific, such as a name or pronouns (e.g., 아이유, 저, 선생님), either particle can be used with no change to the meaning. You would then choose which particle to use based on which noun you want to be the sentence’s focus.  

For example: 

아이유는 한국 출신 가수예요 / 아이유가 한국 출신 가수예요 – IU is a singer from Korea 

Both would be grammatically correct since you are giving general information about a specific person and so both 은/는 and 이/가 are relevant. The only difference is that 아이유는 puts focus of IU whereas 아이유가 doesn’t.  """,

      category: "B1",
      text: """Subject Marking Particles: Advanced usages and differences  

 

These cannot be used in isolation and must be at the END of the noun (hence post-preposition) 

There are 2 types: 
 	Topic marking particles 	Subject marking particles  
Preceding noun with 받침 	은  (e.g. 이것은) 	이 (e.g. 이것이)    
Preceding noun without 받침 	는 (e.g. 저는) 	가 (e.g. 제가) 

 

 

When to use 은/는 

 

There are 4 times when 은/는 should be used: 

 

1. General statement:  

When you are giving general statements/facts about a noun 

제 이름은 빅키입니다 – my name is Vicky  

저는 여자입니다 – I am a woman  

저는 한국인입니다 – I am Korean  

 

2. Put emphasis on the general fact of the subject 

You can think of this as meaning “when it comes to SUBJECT, …” 

e.g., 제니는 자고 있어요 – Jennie is sleeping  

this puts emphasis on the fact that she is sleeping  

 

3. When it is the MAIN subject in a sentence  

The main subject is the subject that governs the rest of the subordinate clauses in a sentence. 

For example, in the sentence “I hope you are happy”, I acts as the main subject governing the subordinate clause “you are happy” and so you is the minor subject. 

Therefore, particles would be attached like this: 

나는 네가 행복하길 바래

 

4. When used for contrast 

You can use this particle when trying to show the distinction between two opposing facts or situations. 

e.g., Jenny isn’t here but Lisa is – 제니가 없지만 리사는 있어요  

In this way, it shows the contrast between the states of the two subjects 

Note how the particle is added to the second subject to show the difference between the first and second clauses. 

 

When to use 이/가 

 

There are 4 times 이/가 should be used: 

 

1. Emphasis on the subject being/doing the action  

You can think of this as pinpointing a certain person out of a large crowd and attributing a state or action to them  

For example, imagine a mother asking her 4 children “Who ate this?”, the child who did might lift a hand and say, “I did.” 

Because of this, 이/가 would be used, forming 제가요 

 

2. When you have more to say about the subject 

Here, follow-up sentences would be related to the subject in the initial sentence 

e.g., 내가 마트에 갔어. 근데 거기서 제프를 만난거야. 반가웠어. – I went to a mart. And I saw Jeff there. It was nice to see him  

 

3. When the subject is NOT the main subject of the sentence  

Using the same example as above, “I hope you are happy”, I acts as the main subject and you is the minor subject. 

Therefore, particles would be attached like this: 

나는 네가 행복하길 바래  

 

4. Fixed expressions 

There are certain verbs that always use the 이/가 particle.  

Examples include 있다 (there is) and 없다 (there isn’t) 

Therefore, unless the subject is being used for contrast, 이/가 would now be used as the particle for general statements. 

e.g., 연필이 있어요 – There is a pencil (general statement) 

         제니가 없어요 – Jennie isn’t here (general statement) 

         제니는 없어요 – Jennie isn’t here (in contrast to all the others that are) 

 

A: 제니가 없어요. 어디 있는지 알아요? – Jennie isn’t here. DO you know where she is? 

B: 저도 몰라요. 리사는 있어요 – I don’t know either. (But) Lisa is here 

 

Therefore, N+ 이/가 + 있/없다 = general statement
and N + 은/는 + 있/없다 = contrast 

 

 

Further examples and explanations 

 

a) 호비가 웃으면 저는 행복해요 – When Hobi smiles, I am happy  

The main subject “I” governs the whole sentence and so uses the 은/는particle 

Hobi acts as the minor subject and so used the 이/가 particle  

 

b) 내가 도와줄게 – Let me help you  

To put emphasis on it is I who’ll help you, the 이/가 particle is used  

 

c) 그 사람은 안 도와줄 건데 나는/내가 도와줄게 – He won’t help you but I will help you  

Here, either 은/는 or 이/가 can be used depending on whether you want to put emphasis on the contrast between the two people (unlike him, I will help) or the fact that is it you that will help  

 

d) A: 누구의 이름이 빅키인가요? – whose name is Vicky? 

제 이름이 빅키입니다 – My name is Vicky  

There is then emphasis on the subject doing/being something 

 

e) A: 제니는 어때요? – How is Jennie? 

B: 제니는 예뻐요 – Jennie is pretty 

This is a general fact that Jennie is pretty and so 은/는particle is used  

 

f) A: 누가 예뻐요? – Who is pretty? 

B: 제니가 예뻐요 – Jennie is pretty  

Emphasis is on the specific subject being pretty and so 이/가 particle is used 

 

g) A: 제니 뭐해요? – What is Jennie doing? 

B: 제니는 지금 자요 – Jennie is sleeping right now 

This is a general fact about Jennie  

 

h) A: 제니한테 전화해보세요 – call Jennie 

B: 제니가 자요. 그래서 못해요 – Jennie is sleeping, so I can’t  

Here, the follow-up sentence is related to the subject in the first sentence and so 이/가 is used BUT제니는 is also an option since it could be putting emphasis on the general state of the subject* 

 

*In these cases, a good alternative would be to completely remove the particles and just say “ 제니 자요” but be careful of this since sometimes particles are needed in order to communicate the right meaning (e.g., when differentiating the main and minor subjects) 

 

 

i) 우리는 네가 웃길 바래 – We hope that you smile.  

은/는particle is attached to “We” the main subject and이/가 particle is added to “you” the minor subject  

 

j) 친구들이 널 괴롭혀도, 나는 널 응원해 – Even if you friends bully you, I will cheer for you  

은/는particle used to contrast between “I” and the person’s “friends” 

 

k) A: 저는 아침을 먹었어요  

B: 저도 먹었어요  

C: 저는 안 먹었어요  

은/는particle used to contrast between person C and people A and B 

 

l) 나는 한국을 좋아해요 – I like Korea  

A general statement and so 은/는particle is used

  Lesson(
    title: "Lesson 3. Object Marking Particles : 을/를",
    category: "B1",
    text: """What is an “object” in a sentence? 

 

From a grammatical point of view, the object of the sentence is the target that is directly affected by the verb/action of the sentence. 

 

For example, 

 
Sentence 	Subject 	Verb 	Object 
I do homework in the evening 	I 	To do  	Homework  
I already ate dinner 	I 	To eat 	Dinner 
I like you 	I 	To like 	You 
Jisoo doesn’t like me  	Jisoo 	To not like  	me 

 

Unlike in English, the object of a Korean sentence comes BEFORE the verb such that: 

 

English: Subject + Verb + Object 

Korean: Subject + Object + Verb 

 

e.g., I like you (English Order) >> I you like  (Korean Order)

 

Much like when marking the subject of the sentence with subject marking particles 이/가 and 은/는, you need to mark the object with the object marking particles 을/를  

When the noun has 받침, 을 is added but if there is no 받침, 를 is added 

 

Example sentences: 

 

    I do homework in the evening – 저는 저녁에 숙제를 해요  

    I already ate dinner – 저는 저녁을 이미 먹었어요  

    I like you – 나는 너를 좋아해 

    Jisoo doesn’t like me – 지수는 나를 안 좋아해 

    I know that word –  저는 그 단어를 알아요 

    Mum didn’t watch that movie yet – 엄마는 그 영화를 아직 안 봤어요  

 

It is important to remember that NOT EVERY sentence has an object. For example, in a sentence like “I am a student” there is no action that directly affects the noun “student” and so there is no object. This is also the case for the phrase “I am smart” where there is only a descriptive verb and thus no requirement for an object.  

 

Verbs to note when using object particles  

 

There are 3 groups of verbs to note when using object particles: 

 

    수여 동사 – bestowal verbs (=verbs that have 2 objects; indirect and direct object) 

These are verbs that imply that you are giving something to someone (/bestowing) 

 

For example, “I gave mum a present” seems to have 2 objects “mum” and “present” 

In Korean, you would define them separately as either an indirect or direct object  

In this phrase, the direct object is the object that is directly affected by the action verb, here “present”, whereas the indirect object is the receiver of the verb, “mum” 

 

Therefore, only the direct object is marked with the object marking particle. 

The indirect object would be marked with either 에게 or 한테 to mean “to (a person)”. In some contexts, it can also mean “from (a person)” but the difference should be understood by context. 

 

SUMMARY 
Example sentence 	Particle used 
 	Indirect object (receiver) 	Direct object 
 	한테/에게 	을/를 
I gave mum a present  	mum 	a present 

 

This applies most commonly to these Korean verbs: 

주다 – to give  

보내다 – to send 

가르치다 – to teach  

말하다/ 말해주다 – to tell  

보여주다 – to show 

사주다 – to buy (for someone) 

가져다 주다 – to bring  

 

Example sentences: 

 

저는 선물을 제 친구한테 줬어요 – I gave my friend a gift 

저는 비밀을 엄마에게 안 말했어요 – I didn’t tell mum my secret  

저는 한국어를 사람들한테 가르쳐요 – I teach people Korean  

아빠는 저한테 선물을 사줬어요 – My dad bought me a gift 

저에게 물을 좀 가져다 주시겠어요? – Can you bring me some water? 

 

NB: 좀 can mean “ a little”, but in contexts like this it can be used to soften commands and make them sound politer 

 

한 시간 전에 사장님께 이메일을 보냈어요 – I sent my boss an email an hour ago 

 

NB: 께 is the honorific form of 에게/한테 and so would be used instead of these when wanting to show respect to the person it is attached to (e.g., boss, elderly etc.) 

 

저는 매일 엄마한테 편지를 썼어요 I wrote mum a letter every day  

저는 지수에게 제 그림을 안 보여줬어요 – I didn’t show Jisoo my drawing  

엄마한테 곧 전화할 거 에요 –  I will call my mum soon 

저희 가족은 저를 귀염둥이라고 불러요 – My family calls me a cutie pie  

당장 지수를 불러! – Tell Jisoo to come here this instance! 

 

    Verbs followed by  이/가 not 을/를  

There are some verbs where the seeming object of the verb needs to be marked with 이/가 instead of 을/를. You can think of these as fixed expressions.  

Some examples of this include: 

To become noun – noun 이/가 되다 

저는 최고가 될 거예요 – I will become the best 

 

NB: The action of becoming is more like a change of state rather than an action that can be targeted to something.  

 

To have a noun – noun 이/가 있다 

저는 동생이 있어요 – I have a younger sibling 

To not have a noun – noun 이/가 없다 

 

NB: Though the meanings of 있다/없다 can extend to mean “to have”, the main underlying meaning of the verbs are “for sth to be there/not be there” and so that something is always a subject and so will take the 이/가 subject marking particles.  

This is unlike the verbs 가지다/갖다 which only mean “to have/to possess/to take noun” and so will its noun will be marked with the object marking particles 을/를. 

 

to like/dislike noun – noun 이/가 좋다, 싫다 

to need noun – noun 이/가 필요하다 

NB: the actual translation of the verb 필요하다 is “to be needed” and not “to need” and so the noun is always a subject and so marked with 이/가 particle (e.g., the phrase “I need a spoon – 숟가락이 필요해요” would literally be translated as “a spoon is needed”). 

 

    Passive Verbs  

 

Passive verbs ALWAYS follow by 이/가 particle instead of 을/를  

You can think of passive verbs as descriptive verbs since they describe the state of something and so will not require any object.  

 

For example: 

 
취소하다 (active) vs 취소되다 (passive) 
To cancel 	To be cancelled 
To cancel sth 	sth is cancelled 
주문을 취소했어요 	주문이 취소됐어요 
I cancelled the order 	The order is cancelled 

 

More verb examples: 

제공하다 vs 제공되다 – to provide, offer (active) / to be provided, offered (passive)

열다 vs열리다 – to open (active) /to be opened (passive)

닫다 vs닫히다 – to close, shut (active) /to be closed, shut (passive)

잠그다 vs잠기다 – to lock (active) /to be locked (passive) 

 

NB: when saying “to be good at” in Korean, it is more natural to say “to do something well”. In this way, this something is always an object and so should be marked with the 을/를object marking particles.  

noun을/를 잘하다 = to be good at noun 

저는 한국어를 잘해요 – I am good at Korean 

The antonym of this would be 못하다 which literally means “to not be able to do”  

 

 

When the object is marked with 은/는 instead of 을/를  

 

Sometimes 은/는 is added to objects to add nuances to the sentence that only this topic marker can add. Commonly, this is used to show contrast or put emphasis on the noun. 

 

For example: 

A: Eunji likes all vegetables, right? – 은지 씨는 모든 채소를 다 좋아하죠? 

B: She doesn’t like onions, but other than that, she likes them all – 양파는 안 좋아하는데 그거 빼고 다 좋아해요 

 

A: I am good at singing – 저는 노래를 잘 불러요 

B: Good for you. I’m not good at singing, but I’m good at dancing – 좋겠네요. 저는 노래는 못하는데 춤은 잘 춰요.""",

  Lesson(
      title:
          "Lesson 4. How to say “I am~,” “My Name is~” (이다 verb & 의 possessive particle)",
      category: "B1",
      text:
          """In this lesson, we’re going to learn how to use the “이다 (to be)” verb. 

“이다” means “to be” and it is always followed by a noun. 

Therefore, the pattern is like this :  Noun + 이다 (=to be noun) 

There is no particle required between the noun and 이다, so 이다 can come directly after the noun.

When you want to make a sentence that goes like : Subject is/are/was/were/will be noun, 이다 verb is used. Here, 이다 corresponds to “is, are, was, were, will be (“to be” variations.)

 
 1. 이다’s Present Tense Conjugation 

1) 존댓말 (polite form) :

Ends in a final consonant (받침) > 이에요

Doesn’t end in a final consonant (X 받침) > 예요

*예요 is often pronounced as 에요

 

e.g.
제 이름은 빅키예요. – My name is Vicky. 

저희 부모님은 한국인이에요. – My parents are Korean.

 

2) 반말 (casual form) :

Ends in a final consonant (받침) > 이야

Doesn’t end in a final consonant (X 받침) > 야

 

e.g.
저는 여자예요. (존댓말) / 나는 여자야. (반말) – I am a girl.

저는 학생이에요. (존댓말) / 나는 학생이야. (반말) – I am a student.

 

이건 제 가방이에요.(존댓말) / 이건 내 가방이야.(반말) – This is my bag.

이 연필은 제 거예요. (존댓말) / 이 연필은 내 거야. (반말) – This pencil is mine. 

 

2. 이다’s Past Tense Conjugation

1) 존댓말 (polite form) :

Noun ends in a final consonant (받침) > 이었어요

Doesn’t end in a final consonant (X 받침) > 였어요

 

2)반말 (casual form)

The same rule applies, but ~요 ending is removed.

 

e.g.
지수는 작년까지 학생이었어. – Jisoo was a student till last year. (반말)

은지는 알코올 중독자였어요. 지금은 좋은 엄마예요. – Eunji was an alcoholic. Now she is a good mother. (존댓말)

 

3. 이다’s Future Tense Conjugation

1) 존댓말 (polite form) :

이다 + ㄹ/을 거예요 > 일 거예요

그 사람은 지수의 남편일 거예요. – That person will be (= might be) Jisoo’s husband. 

그 사람은 지수의 남편이 될 거예요. – That person will become Josoo’s husband. 

In Korean, the future tense is used not only to indicate that somebody “will do/will be”, but also indicates a guess, possibility of something “might do/might be”.

 

2) 반말 (casual form)

이다 + ㄹ/을 거야 = 일 거야

 

4. When “이다” is conjugated to “여”

The conjugation of “이다” in the present tense is “예요” and “이에요”. Such conjugation can only be used at the end of a sentence.

There are cases that require “이다” to be conjugated to “여 (preceding noun doesn’t end in 받침) ” or “이어 (preceding noun ends in 받침) ” 

For example, when combining “이다” with the sentence connector “그래서 = so” you have to conjugate it like this:

이다 + 아/어서 > 여서

(This we’ll learn later when we get to sentence connectors!)

 

5. When not to use the “이다” verb

Jisoo is busy. =지수가 바빠요

In the sentence above, there is no need to use “이다” verb, as there’s no noun that the subject is equal to.  

 

There is a tree. =나무가 있어요.

When you want to indicate that “there is/isn’t something”, you have to use another pattern that looks like this:

Noun 이/가 있다 (for noun to be there, to have noun)
Noun 이/가 없다 (for noun to not be there, to have noun)
 

[Summary]
이다 Verb Conjugation	(if preceding noun ends in 받침)	(if preceding noun ends in vowel)
Present Tense	존댓말 (formal form)	이에요	예요
반말 (informal form)	이야	야

      text: """Just like we learned in the previous lesson, you can say,

“저는(I) + 나라 이름(country name) + 사람 / 인 (person) + 이에요(am)” which literally means, “I am a (country name) person.”

 

Both 사람 and 인 mean “a person.” 

The difference is that 인 is a sino-Korean word and it comes from this hanja “人” which means “a person, human.” 

사람 is a pure Korean word that means the same thing. They can be used interchangeably when saying which country you are from.
 

Miss Vicky is from Korea(한국), so she can say,

저는 한국인이에요. or 저는 한국 사람이에요. = I am Korean. (I am from Korea.)

If you are from the USA(미국), you can say,

저는 미국 사람이에요. or 저는 미국인이에요. = I am American. (I am from the US.)

 

If you are from the Philippines(필리핀), you can say,

저는 필리핀 사람이에요. or 저는 필리핀인이에요. = I’m a Filipino. (I am from the Philippines.)

 

You can find the Korean word that corresponds to your country’s name in the list below.

      category: "B1",
      text: """Korean Verbs (Present Tense)

    Verbs in Korean are always placed at the very end of a sentence.
    All verbs have a Base form that end in ‘ -다 ’.
    The Base form is then Conjugated in Present, Past or Future forms, depending on the respective Conjugation rules.
    Present Tense can be used to state 1) what someone/something is doing/done right now, 2) what is generally the case, 3) imperative sentences (command, urge, suggestion), and it’s also sometimes used for 4) what one will do in the future.

 

CONJUGATING VERBS IN PRESENT TENSE

    A. Stem + 아:

    When the Verb stem’s last letter has ‘ㅏ’ or ‘ㅗ’ vowels and ends in 받침: Delete ‘다’ and add ‘아’

Ex. 알다 (to know) = 알아.

저는 빅키씨를 알아요 = I know Miss Vicky.

Ex. 좋다 (to be good) = 좋아.

날씨가 좋아요 = The weather is good.

Ex. 살다 (to live) = 살아

저는 한국에 살아요 = I live in Korea.

 

    When the Verb stem ends only in the vowel ‘ㅏ’ (and no 받침): Delete ‘다’ and the stem itself is the present conjugated form

Ex. 가다 (to be go) = 가.

저는 학교에 가요 = I go to school.

Ex. 만나다 (to be meet) = 만나.

저는 매일 제프를 만나요 = I meet Jeff everyday.

Ex. 자다 (to sleep) = 자.

저는 일찍 자요 = I sleep early.

  

 

    When the Verb stem ends only in the vowel ‘ㅗ’ (and no 받침): Delete ‘다’ and add ‘ㅏ’  and combine them to : ㅘ                 

Ex. 오다 (to come) = 와  (오다 → 오아 → 와)

비가 와요 = It’s raining.

Ex. 보다 (to see) = 봐  (보다 → 보아 → 봐)

저는 TV를 안 봐요 = I don’t watch TV.

 

 

    B. Stem + 어:

    When the Verb stem’s last letter ends in a vowel other than ‘ㅏ’ or ‘ㅗ’ vowels and ends in 받침: Delete ‘다’ and add ‘어’

Ex. 먹다 (to eat) = 먹어.

나는 매운 음식을 먹어 = I eat spicy food.

Ex. 읽다 (to read) = 읽어.

저는 책을 많이 읽어요 = I read a lot of books.

 

    When the Verb stem’s last letter ends in a vowel other than ‘ㅏ’ or ‘ㅗ’ vowels and ends in ‘ㅐ’, ‘ㅓ’ or ‘ㅕ’ vowels and has no 받침: Simply delete ‘다’ and the stem itself becomes the present conjugated form

      category: "B1",
      text: """Adjectives in Korean have 2 functions:

    They function as a verb in a sentence to complement a subject.
    They act as a modifier to modify a noun after it.

PART 1- When an Adjective functions as a verb:

When Adjectives function as verbs in a sentence, they can be conjugated by following the same Conjugation Rules as verbs!

Ex. Jeff is sad = 제프가 슬퍼요.

Ex. The cat is small = 고양이가 작아요.

슬프다 meaning ‘to be sad’ is conjugated in its Present form as 슬퍼요

and 작다meaning ‘to be small’ is conjugated in its Present form as 작아요.

 

CONJUGATING ADJECTIVES (in Present Tense)

A. Stem + 아:

    Stem’s last letter has ‘ㅏ’ or ‘ㅗ’ vowels; and ends in 받침:

Ex. 짧다 (to be short) = 짧아.

Ex. 좋다 (to be good) = 좋아.

(Delete ‘다’ and add ‘아’)

    Stem ends only in the vowel ‘ㅏ’ (and no 받침):

Ex. 싸다 (to be inexpensive) = 싸. / 싸아(x)

Ex. 비싸다 (to be expensive) = 비싸. / 비싸아 (x)

(Delete ‘다’)

    Stem ends only in the vowel ‘ㅗ’ (and no 받침):

Ex. 오다 (to come) = 와  (오다 → 오아 → 와)

Ex. 보다 (to see) = 봐  (보다 → 보아 → 봐)

B. Stem + 어:

    Stem ends in a vowel other than ‘ㅏ’ or ‘ㅗ’; and ends in 받침:

Ex. 적다 (to be small) = 적어.

Ex. 넓다 (to be wide) = 넓어.

(Delete ‘다’ and add ‘어’)

    Stem ends in vowel ‘ㅣ’:

Ex. 느리다 (to be slow) = 느려.

Ex. 시다 (to be sour) = 셔.

(Delete ‘다’ and ‘ㅣ’ changes to ‘이 + 어 =ㅕ’)

    Adjectives ending in -하다:

Ex. 편하다 (to be comfortable) = 편해.

Ex. 뚱뚱하다 (to be chubby) = 뚱뚱해.

(하다 is conjugated in its Present form = 해)

 

*Irregular Adjectives:

C. Stem ends in the vowel ‘ㅡ’:

    When the letter before the letter containing ‘ㅡ’ vowel has a vowel other than ‘ㅏ’ or ‘ㅗ’-

Ex. 슬프다 (to be sad) = 슬퍼.

Ex. 예쁘다 (to be pretty) = 예뻐.

(Delete the ‘ㅡ’ vowel and add ‘ㅓ’)

    When the letter before the letter containing ‘ㅡ’ vowel has the vowel ‘ㅏ’ or ‘ㅗ’-

Ex. 나쁘다 (to be bad) = 나빠.

Ex. 배 고프다 (to be hungry) = 배 고파.

(Delete the ‘ㅡ’ vowel and add ‘ㅏ’)

    When the letter containing ‘ㅡ’ vowel has no preceding letter-

Ex. 쓰다 (to write; use) = 써.

(Replace the ‘ㅡ’ vowel with ‘ㅓ’)

    When the adjective ends in ‘르’-

Ex. 다르다 (to be different) = 달라.

Ex. 빠르다 (to be quick) = 빨라.

(Add an extra ‘ㄹ’ underneath the previous letter as a 받침and change the 르 into ‘라’)

Ex. 아름답다 (to be beautiful) = 아름다워.

Ex. 덥다 (to be hot) = 더워.

(Delete ‘ㅂ’ 받침 and add ‘워’)

Note: Past and Future conjugations have the same rules as the Present after converting the adjectives into the respective tenses.

Ex.
Adjective	Present Tense	Past Tense	Future Tense
좋다 (to be good)	좋아 (is good)	좋았어 (was good)	좋을 거야 (will be good)
맵다 (to be spicy)	매워 (is spicy)	매웠어 (was spicy)	매울 거야 (will be spicy)

 

PART 2- When an Adjective acts as a modifier:

When an Adjective acts as a modifier, Adjective Modifiers are used.

Ex. Sad Jeff = 슬픈 제프.

Ex. The small cat = 작은 고양이.

 

THE ADJECTIVE MODIFIER

     Stem + ㄴ/은

When stem does not end in 받침: Stem + ㄴ  (슬프다 → 슬픈)

When stem does end in 받침: Stem + 은  (작다 → 작은)

 

Ex. Long hair is beautiful = *긴 머리는 아름다워요.

*길다 = to be long is an irregular adjective form! Simply delete the ‘ㄹ’ 받침 and replace it with ‘ㄴ’.

Ex. Jeff is a good friend = 제프는 좋은 친구예요.

Ex. A cute cat = *귀여운 고양이.

*귀엽다 (to be cute) is an irregular adjective form! Simply delete the ‘ㅂ’ 받침 and add ‘운’ to make it an adjective modifier.

  Lesson(
      title:
          "Lesson 10. Present-Progressive “I am verb-ing” (Verb-고 있다/-는 중이다/ Noun 중이다)",
      category: "B1",
      text:
          """In English, the present progressive is formed by using “am verb-ing”, for example, “I am writing” or “He is singing”.  

 

In Korean, this can be formed in 2 ways in, either: 

 

1. I am (currently) doing something  

VERB STEM + 고 있어요  

e.g., 공부하고 있어요 – I am studying 

 

2. I am (in the middle of) doing something* 

VERB STEM + 는 중이에요  

e.g., 공부하는 중이에요 – I am in the middle of studying 

 

*Note: the second construction has the nuance of being “in the middle” of something because the word 중 comes from the Chinese character 中 with the literal meaning of “middle”. For example, in the word 주중 meaning “weekdays”, it literally comes from the meaning of “in the middle of the week”. 

 

Example Sentences 

 

저는 영화를 보고 있어요 / 보는 중이에요 – I am watching a movie  

저의 (/제) 방을 청소하고 있어요 / 청소하는 중이에요 – I am cleaning my room  

요리하고 있어요 / 요리하는 중이에요 – I’m cooking  

머리를 말리고 있어요 / 말리는 중이에요 – I’m drying my hair  

아침을 만들고 있어요 – I’m making breakfast** 

 

**Note: the verbs 하다 (to do) and 준비하다 (to prepare) can both be used instead of 만들다 (to make) to have the same meaning of “I’m making breakfast”. 

 

아침을 먹고 있어요 / 먹는 중이에요– I’m having breakfast  

밥 먹고 있어요 – I’m having a meal*** 

 

***Note: Similarly to Chinese, 밥 literally means “cooked rice” but it can also be used to mean “meal”. 

 

 

Irregular forms of –는 중이에요 : 

 

Unlike the -고 있어요 construction, the -는 중이에요 can have irregular forms where the verb stem changes for some verbs. 

For example, verbs with ㄹ 받침 have this final ㄹ deleted before the construction is added.  
Base verb  	Combination with –는 중이에요 	Combination with –고 있어요 
만들다 (to make) 	만드는 중이에요  	만들고 있어요  
놀다 (to play, hang out) 	노는 중이에요  	놀고 있어요  
불다 (to blow) 	부는 중이에요  	불고 있어요  

 

Example sentences: 

 

아침을 만드는 중이에요 – I am making breakfast 

친구들과 노는 중이에요 – I am hanging out with my friends  

풀룻을 부는 중이에요 – I am playing (/blowing) the flute 

휘파람을 부는 중이에요 – I am whistling (literally, I am blowing a whistle sound) 

 

Using Nouns with 중이에요

This construction can also be formed with nouns using: 

NOUN + 중이에요 

 

However, this can ONLY be used for nouns that when combined with 하다 become a verb. For example, 공부 meaning “study” can be combined with 하다 to form 공부하다 (to study). However, the noun 커피 meaning “coffee” cannot be combined with 하다 to mean “to drink coffee”. 

  

This construction would translate to “in the middle of NOUN” and is exactly the same as the equivalent 하는 중이에요verb form. For example, 샤워 중이에요 (I am showering) is exactly the same as 샤워하는 중이에요.  

 

More examples: 

 

청소 중이에요 = 청소하는 중이에요 – I am in the middle of cleaning 

요리 중이에요 = 요리하는 중이에요 – I am in the middle of cooking  

준비 중이에요 = 준비하는 중이에요 – I am in the middle of preparing  

수업 중이에요 = 수업하는 중이에요 – I am in the middle of taking a class**** 

다이어트 중이에요 = 다이어트하는 중이에요 – I am in the middle of dieting 

 

****Note: 수업하다 can either mean “to attend a class” as a student or “to do/teach a class” as a teacher. 

 

An EXCEPTION to this rule is 일하다 where it is more natural to use the construction with the verb instead of the noun.  

In this way, 일하고 있어요 / 일하는 중이에요 is more natural than 일 중이에요.  

 

When to use –고 있어요 vs. –는 중이에요  

 

In most cases, these 2 forms are interchangeable, however, when talking about natural or emotional phenomena, it is more natural to use -고 있어요 over -는 중이에요. 

 

For example: 

 

The wind is blowing – natural – 바람이 불고 있어요 > 바람이 부는 중이에요 

I am crying – emotional – 울고 있어요 > 우는 중이에요 

It is raining – natural – 비가 오고 있어요 > 비가 오는 중이에요 

(Literally, the rain is coming) 

 

Present progressive vs. Present Tense 

 

Unlike in English, the present and present progressive are completely interchangeable.  

 

For example: 

A: 뭐 해요? – What are you doing? 

B: 공부해요 – I’m studying. 

 

IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS 

 

A: 뭐 하고 있어요? / 뭐 하는 중이에요? – What are you doing? 

B: 공부하고 있어요 / 공부하는 중이에요 / 공부 중이에요  – I’m studying.""",

          """We learned in the previous lesson that to make a verb in present-progressive form, you can use the following constructions :
1) Verb -고 있다
2) Verb-는 중이다
3) Noun 중이다

and then conjugate them in present tense,

Verb+고 있어요.

Verb+는 중이에요.

Noun 중이에요.

 

Using the constructions above, you can also make it in both Past Progressive and Future Progressive.

You can simply conjugate them in past and future tense form.

1. Past Progressive :
Verb-고 있다 + 았/었어(요) = Verb+고 있었어(요)
Verb-는 중이다 + 았/었어(요) = Verb-는 중이었어(요)
Noun 중이다 + 았/었어(요) = Noun 중이었어(요)

e.g.
공원에서 고양이가 울고 있었어요. A cat was crying in the park.
저는 아까 수업을 듣는 중이었어요. I was taking a class earlier.
회의 중이었어요. 그래서 전화를 못 받았어요. I was in the middle of a meeting. So I couldn’t answer the phone.

 


2. Future Progressive :
Verb-고 있다 + ㄹ/을 거야(or 거예요) = Verb-고 있을 거야 / 거예요
Verb-는 중이다 + ㄹ/을 거야(or 거예요) = Verb-는 중일 거야 / 거예요.
Noun 중이다 + ㄹ/을 거야(or 거예요)  = Noun 중일 거야 / 거예요.

e.g.
엄마는 자고 있을 거예요. Mom will be sleeping.

      category: 'B1',
      text:
          """In this lesson, we’re going to learn how to use Verb-고 싶다 in a sentence to mean «I want to / I prefer to».

 

First of all, Verb-고 싶다 is mostly used when the subject is “I” (it can be used when the subject is “you,” but that’s mostly in questions, like Do you want~?)

 

If the subject is the other or third person, it’s better to use -고 싶어하다 (-고 싶다 + 아/어 하다), which we’ll also briefly cover in this lesson.

 

V-고 싶다 is not used with adjectives or Noun + 이다. To say that someone «wants to be Adjective/Noun», you have to use a different grammatical pattern. (cf. verb-았/었으면 좋겠다 – we’ll learn more about this expression in Beginner 3 course.)

 

Let’s look at some examples:

먹다 (to eat) > 먹고 싶다 – to want to eat

가다 (to go) > 가고 싶다 – to want to go

보다 (to see) > 보고 싶다 – to want to see

되다 (to become) > 되고 싶다 – to want to become

사다 (to buy) > 사고 싶다 – to want to buy

 

Note: Sometimes, you’ll hear native speakers say, “행복하 (to be happy)+고 싶다,” “건강하(to be healthy)+고 싶다” etc using adjectives; although these are spoken quite often and it does get the meaning across, they aren’t entirely grammatically correct. However, as common as they are, you can normally get by using this construction.

 

Now, let’s look at how to use ~고 싶다 using different tenses.

 

    –고 싶다 in the Present Tense (I want to~)

To say that you want to do something in the Present Tense, you have to
1) take the stem of a verb in a sentence,
2) put 고 싶다 directly after this verb,
and 3) then conjugate 싶다 in present tense.

1),2) Verb Stem + 고 싶다 : to want to Verb

3) Verb Stem + 고 싶다 + 아/어요 = Verb-고 싶어(요) : I want to verb

 

Let’s look at some examples:

저는 밥을 먹고 싶어요. – I want to eat.

친구들과 카페에 가고 싶어. – I want to go to a coffee shop with my friends.

저는 한국어를 공부하고 싶어요. – I want to learn Korean.

저는 새 핸드폰을 사고 싶어요. – I want to buy a new phone.

이 책을 읽고 싶어? – Do you want to read this book?

 

    –고 싶다 in Past Tense (I wanted to~)

~고 싶다 can also be used in  Past Tense to indicate that you wanted to do something in the past. To do so, you can conjugate 싶다 in past tense : 싶었어/싶었어요.

 

Verb Stem + 고 싶었어(요) = I wanted to Verb

 

주다 (to give) > 여자친구한테 선물을 주고 싶었어요. – I wanted to give a gift to my girlfriend.

자다 (to sleep)  > 일찍 자고 싶었어요. – I wanted to sleep early.

일어나다 (to wake up) > 늦게 일어나고 싶었어요? – Did you want to wake up late?

공부하다 (to study) > 공부하고 싶었어요. – I wanted to study.

전화하다 (to call) > 전화하고 싶었어. – I wanted to call.

 

    –고 싶다 in Future Tense (I will/might want~)

~고 싶다 can also be used in future tense, and you can simply conjugate 싶다 to a future tense form: 싶을 거예요

Verb Stem + 고 싶을 거예요 = I will/might want to Verb

 

You use it when you want to indicate that you will/might want to do something in the future. You predict or guess your future actions.

Let’s look at the conjugations:

먹다 (to eat) > 먹고 싶을 거예요. – I will/might want to eat.

가다 (to go) > 가고 싶을 거예요. – I will/might want to go.

보다 (to see) > 보고 싶을 거예요. – I will/might want to see/watch, I will/might miss someone. [보고 싶다 also means to miss someone.]

공부하다 (to study) > 공부하고 싶을 거예요. – I will/might want to study.

사다 (to buy) > 사고 싶을 거예요. – I will/might want to buy.

 

    Verb ~고 싶어하다 (when the subject is the third person)

When you want to say that the third person wants to do something, we normally use a different grammatical pattern.

You take a verb stem and add -고 싶어하다 [싶다 + 아/어하다] right after it. We’ll learn more in-depth about Adj+아/어하다 construction in Beginner 2 Course, but for now you can just remember that it’s mostly used with a third-person subject. (*note: -고 싶다 is considered an adjective rather than a verb.]

 

Verb Stem + ~고 싶어하다 :

읽다 (to read) > 읽고 싶어하다

마시다 (to drink) > 마시고 싶어하다

오다 (to come) > 오고 싶어하다

하다 (to do) > 하고 싶어하다

만들다 (to make) > 만들고 싶어하다

 

Now let’s look at some example sentences :

우리 엄마는 케이크를 만들고 싶어해요. – My mom wants to make a cake.

제 친구는 그 영화를 보고 싶어해요. – My friend wants to watch that movie.

제프는 한국어를 잘 하고 싶어해요. – Jeff wants to speak Korean well.

우리 여동생은 가수가 되고 싶어해요. – My younger sister wants to become a singer.

 

    ~고 싶다 Negative Form  (We will learn more in-depth about verb/adj negation in the next lesson!)

 

There are two ways to negate ~고 싶다. Let’s look at both:

    안 + Verb Stem + 고 싶다
    Verb Stem + ~고 싶지 않다

 

먹다 (to eat) > 안 먹고 싶다 / 먹고 싶지 않다. – to not want to eat

가다 (to go) > 안 가고 싶다 / 가고 싶지 않다. – to not want to go

보다 (to see) > 안 보고 싶다 / 보고 싶지 않다. – to not want to watch.

되다 (to become) > 안 되고 싶다 / 되고 싶지 않다. – to not want to become

사다 (to buy) > 안 사고 싶다 / 사고 싶지 않다 – to not want to buy.

 

저는 숙제를 안 하고 싶어요 / 저는 숙제를 하고 싶지 않아요. – I don’t want to do the homework.

저는 일찍 안 자고 싶어요. / 저는 일찍 자고 싶지 않아요. – I don’t want to go to bed early.

제프의 파티에 안 가고 싶어요. / 제프의 파티에 가고 싶지 않아요. – I don’t want to go to Jeff’s party.

비가 와서 밖에 안 가고 싶어요. / 비가 와서 밖에 가고 싶지 않아요. – I don’t want to go outside because it’s raining.

          """In this lesson, you’re going to learn how to negate Korean verbs and adjectives and use them in a sentence.

 

    Verb and Adjective Negation 

A. 안 + Base Verb/Adjective

For example,
하다 (to do) > 안 하다 (to not do) / 안 해요 [present] – 안 했어요 [past] – 안 할 거예요 [future]

 

B. Verb/Adjective Stem + ~지 않다

For example,
하다(to do) > 하지 않다(to not do) / 하지 않아요 [present] – 하지 않았어요 [past] – 하지 않을 거예요 [future]

 

Let’s look at a few examples with verbs in present tense :

우리 아들은 숙제를 해요. – My son does the homework.

우리 아들은 숙제를 안 해요. Or, 우리 아들은 숙제를 하지 않아요. – My son doesn’t do the homework.

 

좋아하다 (to like) > 안 좋아하다/좋아하지 않다 (to not like)

저는 매운 음식을 좋아해요. – I like spicy food.

저는 매운 음식을 안 좋아해요. Or, 저는 매운 좋아하지 않아요. – I don’t like spicy food.

 

먹다 (to eat) > 안 먹다/먹지 않다 (to not eat)

저는 고기를 안 먹어요. Or, 저는 고기를 먹지 않아요. – I don’t eat meat.

 

Now, let’s look at the examples with the past tense:

읽다 (to read) > 안 읽다 / 읽지 않다 (not to read)

저는 그 책을 아직 안 읽었어요. Or, 저는 그 책을 아직 읽지 않았어요. – I didn’t read that book yet.

 

받다 (to receive) > 안 받다/받지 않다 (to not receive)

어제 엄마가 전화를 안 받았어요. Or, 어제 엄마가 전화를 받지 않았어요. – Mom didn’t answer my call yesterday.

 

Examples in the future tense:

사다 (to buy) > 안 사다/사지 않다

저는 이 책을 안 살 거예요.

Or, 저는 이 책을 사지 않을 거예요. – I won’t buy this book.

 

The same rule applies to adjectives.

 

바쁘다 (to be busy) > 안 바쁘다/바쁘지 않다

요즘/요새 저는 안 바빠요.

Or, 요즘 저는 바쁘지 않아요. – I’m not busy these days.

 

달다 (to be sweet) > 안 달다/달지 않다 (to be not sweet)

이 케잌이 안 달아요.

Or, 이 케잌이 달지 않아요. – This cake isn’t sweet

 

Those are the basic rules, but there are also some exceptions.

 

    Negation of “Noun + 하다” Verbs

“Noun 하다” can be seprated to Noun (을/를) + 하다.

e.g.
공부하다 (to study) > 공부 (studying) + 하다 (to do) = to do studying

운동하다 (to work out) > 운동 (exercise) + 하다 (to do) = to do exercise

요리하다 (to cook) > 요리 (cooking) + 하다 (to do) = to do cooking

 

In this case, we don’t need to negate a noun, and we need to negate a verb. To do so, we need to separate a noun and a verb and then negate the verb.

Noun + 안 + 하다

Or Noun+하+지 않다

 

공부하다 (to study) > 공부(를) 안 하다 (to not study)

Or, 공부하지 않다

 

운동하다 (to exercise) > 운동(을) 안 하다 (to not work out)

Or, 운동하지 않다

 

요리하다 (to cook) > 요리(를) 안 하다 (to not work out)

Or, 요리하지 않다

 

*말하다 (to speak) > 말 (spoken words) + 하다 (to do) > 말 안 하다 (not to speak = 안 말하다)

* 말하다 is one of the 하다 verbs which can be negated with both ways.

 

Let’s look at some example sentences:

저는 요리(를) 안 해요. – I don’t cook.

Or, 저는 요리하지 않아요.

 

저는 어제 운동(을) 안 했어요. – I didn’t work out yesterday.

Or, 저는 어제 운동하지 않았어요.

 

저는 오늘 공부(를) 안 할 거예요. – I will not study today.

Or, 저는 오늘 공부하지 않을 거예요.

 

저는 엄마한테 말(을) 안 할 거예요. (= 저는 엄마한테 안 말할 거예요).

Or, 저는 엄마한테 말하지 않을 거예요.

** 좋아하다 is not a combination of Noun + 하다, so we don’t separate it.

 

    Negation of “Noun + 하다” Adjectives

When you want to negate Noun + 하다 adjectives, they cannot be separated, unlike verbs.
So you can just negate it in a regular way:

안 + Adjective

Or Adjective + 지 않다


건강하다 (to be healthy) > 건강 (health) > 안 건강하다 / 건강하지 않다 (to be not healthy)

행복하다 (to be happy) > 행복 (happiness) > 안 행복하다 / 행복하지 않다 (to be not happy)

똑똑하다 (to be smart) > 안 똑똑하다 / 똑똑하지 않다 (to be not smart)

 

Let’s look at some examples:

저는 안 건강해요. (= 저는 건강하지 않아요) – I am not healthy. / 건강 안 해요 (X)

저는 별로 안 똑똑해요. (= 저는 별로 똑똑하지 않아요). – I am not that smart. / 똑똑 안 해요 (X)

 

    Verbs with Separate Negation Words

a) Noun 이/가 있다 : there to be noun, to have noun

*있다 is never followed by 을/를

But when you want to negate “있다”, it doesn’t follow any of the rules described above, but has its own negative form “없다”.


Noun 이/가 없다 : there not to be noun, to not have noun

 

Let’s look at a few examples:

커피가 있어요 (There is coffee.) <> 커피가 없어요 (There is no coffee.)

양말이 있어요 (I have socks) <> 양말이 없어요. (I have no socks.)

 

The same rule applies to many other adjectives that contain “있다” or “없다,” like 재미있다(to be fun) <> 재미없다(to be not fun) or맛이 있다 (to be delicious) <> 맛이 없다 (to be not declicious)

 

b) Verb ~ㄹ/을 수 있다 (to be able; can) <> Verb ~ㄹ/을 수 없다 (=못 + Verb) – More on this on Beginner 2 Course

저는 할 수 있어요. – I can do it.

저는 할 수 없어요. – I can’t do it.

 

c) 맛있다 (to be tasty) > 맛없다 (to be not tasty) (= 맛있지 않다)

 

d) 재미있다 (to be fun) > 재미없다 (to be not fun) (= 재미있지 않다)

 

    Present Progressive : ~고 있다 

*Verb-고 있다 (present progressive)

When negating Present Progressive, you CANNOT say “Verb-고 없다.” But instead, it can be used like this:


안 + Verb-고 있다

Verb-고 있지 않다

 

e.g.
아빠가 지금 티비를 보고 있어요. – Dad is watching TV now.

<>

아빠가 지금 티비를 보고 있지 않아요. – Dad isn’t watching TV now.

Or, 아빠가 지금 티비를 안 보고 있어요.

 

 

고양이가 자고 있어요. – The cat is sleeping.

<>

고양이가 자고 있지 않아요. – The cat isn’t sleeping.

Or, 고양이가 안 자고 있어요.

 

 

엄마는 요리를 하고 있어요. – My mom is cooking.

<> 엄마는 요리하고 있지 않아요.  Or, 엄마는 요리(를) 안 하고 있어요. – My mom isn’t cooking.

 

 

    6. Verb-고 싶다’s negation (We will learn more on this grammar in Beginner 2 course)

*Verb ~고 싶다 (to want to verb) >

Verb ~고 싶지 않다,  안 + Verb ~고 싶다 (to not want to verb),

 

Let’s look at some examples:

저는 일찍 일어나고 싶지 않아요. Or, 저는 일찍 안 일어나고 싶어요.– I don’t want to wake up early.

 

저는 생각하고 싶지 않아요. Or, 저는 생각 안 하고 싶어요. – I don’t want to think.

 

 

    모르다as a Negative Form of 알다

알다 (to know) <> 모르다 (to not know)

*안 알다 is a wrong way to say “to not know”

 

저는 이 단어를 몰라요. – I don’t know this word.

**the right conjugation of 모르다: 몰라요, 몰랐어요, 모를 거예요.

저는 몰랐어요. – I didn’t know.

 

 

    7. Why it’s important to know the correct negative forms

Some grammar rules have to be followed by a verb’s negative form.

For example:

Noun 밖에 + Negative Verb = only noun

1000원 밖에 없어요. – I only have 1,000 won.

저는 야채 밖에 안 좋아해요. – I only like vegetables.

*싫어하다 (to hate) is not 좋아하다’s negative form. It’s just an antonym of 좋아하다.

 

 

    The Negation of 이다

Subject + Noun 이다 = Subject is Noun

To say that something is not something, we need to use 아니다 verb: Subject + Noun 이/가 아니다

*아니다 means “to be not”

Let’s look at the example sentences:

저는 학생이에요. – I am a student.

저는 학생이 아니에요. – I am not a student.

 

저는 여자예요. – I am a woman.

저는 여자가 아니에요. – I am not a woman.

 

저는 한국인이에요. – I am Korean.

저는 한국인이 아니에요. – I am not Korean.

 

 

[Summary]

Basic rule:

안 + Base Verb/Adjective

Verb/Adjective Stem + ~지 않다

 

Verbs and Adjectives ends in 하다:

Noun + 안 + 하다

or Verb하지 않다

 

Verbs with Separate Negation Words:

    Noun 이/가 있다 > Noun 이/가 없다
    Verb ~ㄹ/을 수 있다 (to be able; can) > Verb ~ㄹ/을 수 없다 (=못 + Verb)
    맛있다 (to be tasty) > 맛없다 (to be not tasty) (= 맛있지 않다)
    재미있다 (to be fun) > 재미없다 (to be not fun) (= 재미있지 않다)

Negating Present Progressive:

안 + Verb Stem ~고 있다

Verb Stem ~고 있지 않다

 

Negating ~고 싶다:

Verb ~고 싶지 않다 (to not want to verb)

안 + Verb ~고 싶다

 

 Negating 알다 : 

알다 > 모르다 (몰라요, 몰랐어요, 모를 거예요)

 

 

Negating 이다:

Subject + Noun 이다 (to be) > Subject + Noun 이/가 아니다 (to be not)""",

  Lesson(
      title: "Lesson 13. What are Counters? (+Basic Korean Counters)",
      category: "B1",
      text: """Before we start, you can check this for reference:
1) counter = counter word = measure word (they’re used to mean the same thing in this lesson!)
2) Native Korean Number = Pure Korean Number

 

In this lesson, you’re going to learn the usage of counter words and the question word “몇(how many)” that can be used along with it.

 

“몇” is a question word that means “how many,” and it’s always followed by one of the corresponding counter word of the noun you’re counting.

몇 + counter word? = (how many of ~?)

 

To understand what a counter word is, let’s look at some examples in English:

Three bottles of water

Two plates of lasagna

A cup of coffee

… bottles, plates, and cups are the counter words, but in Korean, these are a little bit different words.

 

Let’s look more closely at the most common ones:

개 > a counter word for non-living things/items/objects

명 > a counter word for people

마리 > a counter word for animals

 

So, if you want to say how many of something there are, you will need counter words:

Five pens > 펜 다섯 개

Six people > 사람 여섯 명 

Eight dogs > 강아지 여덟 마리

 

When we state the number of something, in most cases, a counter word is used along with a Pure Korean Number.

But remember, when 하나(1), 둘(2), 셋(3), 넷(4) and 스물(20) are used with counter words, they change their form:

하나 > 한 개

둘 > 두 개

셋 > 세 개

넷 > 네 개

스물 > 스무 개

열 하나> 열 한 개

열 둘> 스물 두 개

스물 셋> 스물 세 개

스물 넷> 스물 네 개

 *other numbers stay as they are.

 

방에 (사람) 스물 두 명이 있어요. – There are 22 people in the room.

** it’s not always necessary to put a noun(사람), because it’s obvious that we’re talking about people from the counter word 명.

 

저는 사탕 열세 개를 먹었어요. – I ate 13 candies.
***You can put the noun(사탕) here because it’s not obvious what you mean when counting “개,” since “개” can be used to count various items.) 

 

Besides the most common counter words like 개, 명 and 마리, there are counter words used for counting specific things:

잔 > a counter word for cups 

대 > a counter for big things (cars, buildings, machines etc)

권 > a counter word for books 

 

For example:

커피 한 잔 > a cup of coffee

컴퓨터 한 대 > one computer

책 세 권 > three books 

*** in all the examples above, all counter words can be replaced with “개,” because they’re counting non-living things. It is more desirable, though, to use these specific counters to sound more natural and native. 

 

Now, let’s look at how to build a question with “몇”.

 

몇 + (counter word for a specific noun) + 이다?

And we’ll get:

몇 개예요? – How many are there?

몇 명 이에요? – How many people are there?

몇 마리 예요? – How many animals there are?

사과가 몇 개예요? – How many apples are there?

아이들이 몇 명이에요? – How many children are there?

 

The counter word “몇”, can also be used with “있다” or other verbs.

연필 몇 개 있어요? – How many pencils are there?

가족이 몇 명 있어요? – How many people are there in your family?

애완동물 몇 마리 키워요? – How many pets do you have/raise?

 

“몇” can also be used when asking about 1) age, 2) time, and 3) duration.

 

 1) 살: a counter word for age

And if you want to ask somebody about their age, you can say:

몇 살이에요? Or, 몇 살이세요? (more polite)

* Pure Numbers are used with age

 

2) When talking about time in Korean, the word “시간(hours)” is used. But when we say a specific time “시(o’clock)” is used. 

시: a counter word for hour-based time

1 o’clock > 한 시

2 o’clock > 두 시

3 o’clock > 세 시 

12 o’clock > 열 두시

… and so on.

 

So, when asking the time, you can say like this:

몇 시예요?

 

If you also want to say minutes you need to use a counter word for minutes, which is “분”.

11:20 > 11시 20분 

Hours are used with Pure Korean numbers.

Minutes with Sino-Korean numbers.

 

Let’s look at more examples:

3:30 > 세 시 삼십 분 > 세 시 반

**삼십 분 can be replaced with “반” which means “half”.

(We’ll learn more about telling times in one of the next lessons!)

 

3) Also, we use “몇” when asking about duration, like “how many hours, months, years, etc…”.

Hours: 몇 시간 (Sino-Korean Numbers)

Months: 몇 달 (Pure Korean Numbers) or 몇 개월 (Sino-Korean Numbers)

Years: 몇 년 (Sino-Korean Numbers)

몇 시간 이에요? How many hours is it?

몇 시간 걸려요? – How many hours does it take?

한국에 몇 달/개월* 동안** 있었어요? – How many months have you been staying in Korea?

* When we use 달(month counter), Pure Korean numbers are used. For 개월(month counter), we use Sino-Korean numbers.

1 month > 한 달 or 1개월 (일 개월)

10 months > 열 달 or 10 개월 (십 개월)

** “동안” can be used after a stated time to mean “for (the amount of time)”.

 

한국에 몇 년 있었어요? – How many years have you been in Korea?

1년 동안 있었어요. – I’ve been here for a year.

10년 동안 있었어요. – I’ve been here for ten years.

 

 

Here’s the summary of all the counters we learned :

몇 (counter word for a specific noun) + (이다)

개 > a counter word for non-living things

명 > a counter word for people

마리 > a counter word for animals

잔 > a counter word for cups

대 > a counter for big things (car, building, machines etc)

권 > a counter word for books

살 > a counter word for age

시 > a counter word for time

시간 > a counter word for hours

분 > a counter word for minutes

(native)달/(sino)개월 > a counter word for months

년 > a counter word for years

All of these counters are used with Pure Korean Numbers except for 분, 개월, and 년 (they’re used with Sino numbers).""",

  Lesson(
      title: "Lesson 14. Plural Marker/Suffix 들",
      category: "B1",
      text: """들 has three grammatical usages :
★1) particle attached after a noun to make it plural
★2) suffix attached after an adverb or the whole sentence to indicate the omitted subject is plural
    3) dependent noun (this one’s rather an advanced grammar and isn’t very commonly used in spoken form, so we’ll skip this for now.) 

In this lesson, we are mostly focusing on 들 as a particle, plural marker, and will briefly cover its usage as a suffix.

 

1. 들 as a Particle : Plural Marker

Absolutely correct usage of the Plural marker “들” is still being debated among native Korean linguists. Therefore, I find it unnecessary for learners to study the 100% correct grammatical details (as it’s hard to tell even for native speakers), and focus more on how it’s commonly used by the general public.

To make a noun plural in Korean, you can simply attach 들 after the noun that is considered countable.

아이(child) > 아이들 (children)

사람(person) > 사람들 (people)

동물(animal) > 동물들 (animals)

손님(customer, guest) > 손님들(customers, guests)

질문(question) > 질문들 (questions)

단어(word) > 단어들(words)

친구(friend) > 친구들(friends)

날(day) > 날들 (days)

새(bird) > 새들 (birds)

언어(language)> 언어들(languages)

책(book) > 책(books) 

차(car) > 차들(cars)

 

However, when you are specifying there are more than one person/thing/animal with the corresponding counter, it’s not necessary to mark the noun with 들, as it already implies the noun is plural. That doesn’t mean it’s unacceptable to use 들 when the counter is plural. Some people still use it together, but it’s more common (and convenient!) to omit 들 in the presence of plural counters.

고양이 다섯 마리 five cats   (=다섯 마리의 고양이)

손님 네 분 four customers  [분: honorific of 명]   (=네 분의 손님)

아이들* 네 명 four children   (=네 명의 아이들)
*we more commonly use 아이들 than 아이, even with plural counters.

책 여섯 권 six books   (=여섯 권의 책)

차 두 대 two cars   (=두 대의 차)

언어 여섯 개 six lanugages   (=여섯 개의 언어)

친구 열 명 ten friends   (=열 명의 친구)

 

 

You can also omit 들 when it implies there are “many” of the noun. 

In this case, the most commonly used word and its variations would be

많다[adj] : to be many 
많은[modifier]: many
많이[adv]: a lot 

or 몇 명/마리/개/etc (some, a few)

e.g.

공원에 사람이 많아요. There are many people in the park. (No need to say 사람들, although that wouldn’t be completely incorrect.)

많은 질문을 받았어요. I got a lot of questions. (No need to say 질문들, although that wouldn’t be completely incorrect.)

사과를 많이 먹었어요. I had a lot of apples. (No need to say 사과들, although that wouldn’t be completely incorrect.) 

고양이 몇 마리가 길거리에서 울고 있어요. A few cats are crying on the street. (No need to say 고양이들, although that wouldn’t be completely incorrect.)

과자 몇 조각을 먹었더니 배가 불러요. After having a few pieces of snacks, I’m full. (No need to say 과자들 – actually 과자 is considered uncountable noun, so saying 과자들 sounds unnatural anyways.)

 

2. 들 as a Suffix

When 들 is used as a suffix, it can be attached after an adverb or even the whole sentence to indicate that the subject of that sentence is plural. Thus, it is often used in a sentence where the subject is omitted.

 

일찍들 주무세요! (You guys) Sleep early!

늦지 마세요들. (You guys) Don’t be late!

아주 열심히들 공부하네. They (My students/Children/Friends or whomever you’re observing) are studying very hard. 

왜 이렇게들 난리야? (You people) Why the fuss like this?

 축제에 사람이 많이들 왔네요*. A lot of people have come to the festival.
*In this sentence, the subject (사람) isn’t omitted, but 들 can still be used as a suffix to emphasize that there are a lot of people/things.


You will hear Korean people use 들 this way quite commonly in spoken form.""",

  Lesson(
      title: "Lesson 15. How to say, “I am ( ) years old”",
      category: "B1",
      text:
          """In this lesson, you will learn how to say “I’m _ years old” in Korean. Let’s start! 

 

 

나이 means “age” in Korean. But we don’t use this specific word when telling our age. Instead, we use a counter “살” which is used for counting age.

 

 

Let’s look at the pattern you will use when telling your age: 

 

저는 (your age) 살이에요. (존댓말 – polite Korean) 

나는 (your age) 살이야. (반말 – casual Korean) 

 

살 = a measure word (or counter) for your years of age. 

In Korean, there are two types of numbers: Sino Korean and Native(=Pure) Korean numbers. In different situations, we use different numbers, but when it comes to age – Native Korean numbers are used. 

Ex. 저는 19 (열 아홉) 살이에요. 

Sino Korean 19 = 십구 

Native Korean 19 = 열 아홉 

 

Ex. 나는 31 (서른 한) 살이야.  

 

Just like we learned in the previous counter lesson, when you use Native Korean numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 with measure words, they change their form to: 

1 하나 > 한 

2 둘 > 두 

3 셋 > 세 

4 넷 > 네 

Ex. 31 = 서른 하나, but when combined with a measure word, it becomes > 서른 한 살 

서른 한 개 (* 개 is a measure word for the number of things) 

서른 한 명 (* 명 is a measure word for the number of people) 

 

 

Let’s look at more examples: 

Ex.  I’m 22 years old. – 저는 스물 두 (not 둘) 살이에요. 

Ex. I’m 3 years old. – 저는 세살이에요. (not 저는 셋살이에요) 

Ex. I’m 34 years old. – 저는 서른 네살이에요. (not 저는 서른 넷살이에요) 

 

The rest of the numbers (다섯, 여섯, 일곱, 여덟, 아홉) don’t change their form when combined with measure words. 

Ex. 나는 다섯 살이야. – I’m 5 years old. 

Ex. 저는 열 여섯 살이에요. – I’m 16 years old. 

Ex. 저는 서른 여덟 살이에요. – I’m 38 years old. 

Ex. 저는 마흔 아홉 살이에요. – I’m 49 years old.  

 

 

There’s one more number that changes its form – 스물 (20). 

Let’s look at how it changes when combined with measure words: 

 

스무 살 

스무 개 

스무 명 

 

But other 10-unit numbers such as 열(10), 서른(30), 마흔(40) etc., stay the same. 

 

열 살 

서른 명 

마흔 개 

That was the first way to say your age in Korean.



You can also use the second way which is popular among Koreans. 

So, instead of saying your age, you can say your birth year. Note that we use Sino-Korean numbers with years. 

Ex. 1995 > 저는 1995 (천구백구십오) 년생이에요. – I was born in 1995. 

년 = year indicator  / 생(生) = born/birth

 

Or, you don’t always have to say the full year. You can only use the last two numbers. 

Ex. 1982 > 저는 82(팔십이) 년생이에요. – I was born in 1982. 

Ex. 1975 > 저는 75(칠십오) 년생이에요. – I was born in 1975. 

Ex. 2000 >저는 00 (공공)년생이에요. Or 저는 2000 (이천) 년생이에요. – I was born in 2000. 

Ex. 2004 > 저는 04 (공사)년생이에요. – I was born in 2004. 

 

 

If you want to ask a person how old they are, the most casual way would be :

 

 

몇 살 이세요?  / 몇 살이에요?

몇 = how many 

살= years of age 

 

You can use a 반말 form to ask a younger person their age: 

몇 살이야? (몇 is a question word for “how many,” so it would literally mean “How many years old are you?”) 


There are also more polite ways to ask someone’s age :

나이가 어떻게 되세요? 

= How old are you?

 

If you ask a person who is way older than you, you can replace “나이” with “연세가”. 

연세가 어떻게 되세요? 

연세 = age (but with more respect to a person) 

 

Noun이/가 어떻게 되세요 is a polite way to ask what person’s noun (name, gender, age, job etc) is. 

You can check this page for more explanation about this pattern “noun 이/가 어떻게 되세요?”

 

 

 

So now you can say your age in Korean and ask other people how old they are.

Once again, don’t forget about a few rules when 1, 2, 3, 4, and 20 are combined with counters.
Also, make sure to pay attention to the level of politeness when asking a person’s age.

      category: "B1",
      text:
          """In this lesson, we’re going to learn how to say the date in Korean. Please make sure you know how to read Korean numbers at least up to a thousand. When telling the date in Korean, Sino Korean numbers are used. 

 

Let’s look at this example: 

오늘은 2020년 2월 18일입니다. (=Today is February 18th, 2020.) 

As you can guess, “2020년 2월 18일” is the date. 

Unlike in English where you say in the order of “day – month – year,” in Korean, we say it backward and start with a bigger number : “year – month – day”. 

Also, you need to note that, in English, you break down the year into two numbers (ex. 2020 – twenty twenty), but in Korean we read the full number. That’s exactly why you need to know how to read big numbers. 

So, let’s learn how to say the date from the example below: 

2020년 (year) / 2월 (month)  / 18일 (day) 

Let’s break this date down into units. 

1. Year  

Year Number + 년 (*년 means year) 

 

2. Month 

Month Number + 월 

When we say a month name, all you need to do is to remember the number of a month and add 월 right next to it. So you’ll get: 

January = 1월 (일월 il-wol) 

February = 2 월 (이월 ee-wol) 

March = 3월 (삼월sam-wol) 

April = 4월 (사월 sa-wol) 

May = 5월 (오월 o-wol) 

*June = 6월 (유월 yoo-wol) 

July = 7월 (칠월 chil-wol) 

August = 8월 (팔월 pal-wol) 

September = 9월 (구월 goo-wol) 

**October = 10월 (시월 si-wol) 

November = 11월 (십일월sib-il-wol) 

December = 12월 (십이월 sib-ee-wol) 

* note that when we pronounce or write 6 월 (June), it’s not “육월 ” but “유월.” It’s an irregular pronunciation rule. (usually to alleviate discomfort when pronouncing)  

** the same works with 10월 , it’s not 십월 but 시월. 

 

3. Day 

Now, let’s learn how to say day in Korean. It’s quite simple. You just put the number of today’s day and then 일 right next to it. 

The number of a day + 일 

March 1st = 3월 1일 (삼월 일일 sam-wol il-il) 

April 2nd = 4월 2일 (사월 이일 sa-wol i-il) 

May 3rd = 5월 3일 (오월 삼일 o-wol sam-il) 

June 4th = 6월 4일 (*note 6월 is read as 유월, not 육월) (유월 사일yu-wol sa-il) 

July 31st = 7월 31일 (칠월 삼십일일 chil-wol sam-sib-il) 

December 28th = 12월 28일 (십이월 이십팔일 sib-i-wol i-sib-pal-il) 

 

It’s easy, right? So now, let’s practice with full numbers! 

Ex. December 23rd, 1992 – 1992년 12월 23일 (or 천 구백 구십 이년 십이월 이십삼일) 

Ex. October 15th, 2011 – 2011년 10월 15일  (or 이천 십일년 시월 십오일) 

Ex. February 18th, 2020 – 2020년 (or 이천 이십년 이월 십팔일) 

 

The name of the day :

월요일 = Monday

화요일 = Tuesday

수요일 = Wednesday

목요일 = Thursday

금요일 = Friday

토요일 = Saturday

일요일 = Sunday""",

      category: "B1",
      text:
          """Pure Korean number is used for telling hour–unit time like 1 o’clock, 2 o’clock, 2 hours, 3 hours etc.

Pure Korean Numbers are also used for counting items, books, people, and age, combined with the appropriate counter words.

On the other hand, Sino Korean number is used for telling minute–unit time, like 30 minutes, one thirty (1:30) etc.

It is also used while measuring length, height, and weight, again with the appropriate counter words.

 

    Time on the Clock [시 (o’clock) / 분 (minute)]

Like we discussed before, while telling time, you use pure Korean Numbers.

For example, 한 시 means 1 o’clock, and 한 is the pure number and 시 is time marking particle.)

Now when pure Korean Numbers from 1-4 (하나, 둘, 셋, and 넷) are used with counter words, they get changed like this :

하나 – 한

둘 – 두

셋 – 세

넷 – 네

 

Therefore, you can say :

한 시 – 1 o’clock

두 시 – 2 o’clock

세 시 – 3 o’clock

네 시 – 4 o’clock

 

For 5-10 (다섯, 여섯, 일곱, 여덟, 아홉, 열), they remain the same and they don’t change their form.

e.g.

다섯 시 – 5 o’clock

여섯 시 – 6 o’clock

일곱 시 – 7 o’clock

여덟 시 – 8 o’clock

아홉 시 – 9 o’clock

열 시  – 10 o’clock

 

But for 11 o’clock and 12 o’clock it again works like before :

열 한 시 not 열하나 시

열 두 시 not 열둘 시

 

Now, let’s move on to minute-unit time marker, 분.

How do you say 2:10 o’clock in Korean?

First we need to remember that while Pure Korean Numbers were used to tell the hour-unit time, Sino Korean Numbers are used for marking minute-unit time.

2:10 is 두 시 십 분.

5:30 is 다섯 시 삼십 분 (=다섯 시 반)

There is another way to say 30 mins in Korean, which is 반.

반(半) means half, and it’s interchangeable with 삼십 분.
Also make sure to remember that we cannot say  반 분. you can just say “반,” without attaching any time-counters.

 

3:15 is 세 시 십오 분

4:20 is 네 시 이십 분

12:55 is 열 두 시 오십오 분

11:50 is 열 한 시 오십 분

 

You can also use 오전 & 오후 to tell whether it’s AM or PM,

To break this word “오전” down, so that you remember this word effectively, 오 comes from the word “정오” which means “noon” and 전 is a word that means “before.” So it’s literally “beforenoon,” thus AM time.

Also 후 is the word means after, so 오후 would be afternoon that is PM.

오전 & 오후 are placed before the time, unlike English where AM and PM are placed after the time.

 

11am = 오전 열 한 시

7 pm = 오후 일곱 시

7:30 pm = 오후 일곱 시 반 or 오후 일곱 시 삼십 분

 

    Duration (시간: hours / 분: minutes)

When you tell the time duration, the counter you use is 시간. 시간 means “time,” but it is also a measure word for marking how many hours.

And it works the same way we learned, telling the time itself: Pure Numbers for time duration (hours), Sino Numbers for minute duration. So if you want to say one hour, you say 한 시간 not 한 시. 한 시 would mean 1o’clock (time on the clock).

 

2 hours 두 시간

3 hours 세 시간

4 hours 네 시간

 

It’s good to note that when what you are counting is below 20 (including hours), we use pure Korean Numbers, and if it’s over 20, we can use both Pure & Sino Korean Numbers (both are acceptable.) 

But for over 100, there is no pure Korean numbers for it, so you can use Sino Korean Numbers.

For minutes duration, we use the same 분. Like we learned, for minutes, we use Sino Korean Numbers. So,

1 minute is 일 분

10 minutes is 십 분

30 minutes is 삼십 분

 

30 minutes alone of time duration cannot be interchangeably used with “반.” But, 반 can be interchangeable when 30 minutes is combined with hour-unit duration.

30 minutes = 30 분 (O) 반 분 (X)

an hour and a half = 한 시간 삼십 분(O) 한 시간 반(O)

Eight hours thirty minutes = 여덟 시간 삼십 분 (O) 여덟 시간 반 (O)""",

  Lesson(
      title: "Lesson 18. Time Duration (Particle 동안, 간)",
      category: "B1",
      text: """1. Time Duration + 동안

If you want to say for how long you did something in Korean, you can simply add the corresponding number with the corresponding counter, and then add the duration particle “동안.”

In this case, you can also replace 동안 with 간(間), a sino Korean word that means duration. But when you are using hour-unit duration (시간), it’s better to use 동안 than 간.

 

*seconds: Sino Number + 초

*minutes : Sino Number + 분

*hours : Pure Number + 시간

*days : Sino Number + 일

 

e.g.
10초 동안(=10초 간) : for ten seconds 

널 20분 동안 (=20분 간) 기다렸어. I waited you for 20 minutes.

네 시간 동안 뭐 했어요? What did you do for four hours?

한국에 5일 동안 (=5일 간) 있었어요. I stayed in Korea for five days. 

 

Additionally, there are pure Korean versions that are commonly used in place of “one, two, three, four and ten days” 

하루: one day (=일일)

이틀: two days (=이일)

사흘: three days (=삼일)

나흘: four days (=사일)

열흘: ten days (=십일)

They are interchangeable with its sino-Korean equivalent, but oftentimes using the pure Korean word sounds more natural.

 

*weeks : Sino Number + 주 (=주일)

*months : (pure) 달, (sino) 개월 [from 1~4 months, we usually use 달, and from above 5 months, we usually use 개월]

*years : Sino Number + 년

 

More example sentences:

십 초 동안 for ten seconds > 알람 시계가 십 초 동안 울렸어요. The alarm clock rang for 10 seconds.

한 시간 동안 for an hour > 밥을 한 시간 동안 먹었어요. I had a meal for an hour.

열 시간 동안 for ten hours > 열 시간 동안 잤어요. I slept for ten hours.

이틀 간 for two days > 그 호텔에 이틀 간 있었어요. I stayed in that hotel for three days.

오일 동안 for five days > 미국에서 오일 동안 여행할 거예요. I will travel in the US for five days.

삼 주/삼 주일 간 for three weeks > 제프랑 삼 주일/삼 주 간 사귀고 헤어졌어요. I dated Jeff for three weeks and then we broke up.

한 달 동안 for a month > 한국어를 한 달 간(=한 달 동안) 공부했어요. I studied Korean for a month.

육 개월 동안 for six months > 너의 답장을 육 개월 동안 기다렸어. I waited for your reply for six months.

이 년 간 for two years > 저는 서울에 2년 간 살고 있어요. I’ve been living in Seoul for two years.

십 년 동안 for ten years > 반려견을 10년 동안 키웠어요. I raised my pet dog for 10 years.

 

2. Noun + 동안(에)

동안 can also be attached after a noun that refers to a specific time frame, like 방학(vacation), 시험 기간(exam prep period), 점심/저녁 시간(lunch/dinner time), 수업 시간(class hours), 쉬는 시간(break time/recess), 선거 기간(election period) etc. You can also say “동안에” in this case.

In addition, 동안 is not interchangeable with 간(間) in this case. 간 is used only with time duration. 

 

방학 동안 아르바이트를 했어요. I worked part-time during vacation.

쉬는 시간 동안에 뭐 했어요? What did you during the recess? 

대통령 후보들은 선거 기간 동안 많이 바쁠 거예요. Presidential candidates will be busy during the election period.

점심 시간 동안 지수랑 많은 얘기를 했어요. I talked with Jisoo about many things during lunch time. 

3월 동안 열심히 일했어요. I worked hard in the month March.

 

동안 can also be combined with a verb with this construction : Verb-는 동안 (while verb-ing)""",

It is always attached after the amount/length/number of things, people or animals (i.e. Counters) to indicate frequency or allocated amount/time. Also, unlike 마다, it doesn’t indicate the intervals at which something happens. It more indicates the duration of what happens.

  Lesson(
      title: "Lesson 21. How to ask questions in Korean",
      category: "B1",
      text:
          """In today’s lesson, we’re going to learn how to ask questions in Korean. 

 

There are two main types of questions: 

    General Question (or yes/no questions). 
    Specific Questions (using wh-words like what, who, when, where, why, etc). 

In today’s lesson, we’re going to learn the first type of question, asking general questions (with Yes and No for an answer.) 

 

1. The most basic way to form general questions

Unlike in English, in Korean, we don’t change the word order in a sentence when asking a question. To make a question, you can put a “question mark” at the end of the same sentence and just raise the tone. 

For example, let’s look at the normal affirmative sentence: 

미국에서 왔어요. – I am from the USA. 

To make it into a question, you can simply say : 

미국에서 왔어요? – Are you from the USA?

 

Let’s look at some more examples: 

한국을 좋아해요. – I like Korea. 

한국을 좋아해요? – Do you like Korea? 

 

한국어 잘해요. – I am good at Korean. 

한국어 잘해요? – Are you good at Korean? 

 

점심 먹었어. – I had lunch. 

점심 먹었어? – Did you have lunch? 

 

피곤해. – I am tired. 

피곤해? – Are you tired? 

 

배고파. – I am hungry. 

배고파? – Are you hungry? 

 

To make a sentence, the only thing you need is to put a question mark at the end of the sentence and raise the tone.  

However, this is not the only way to ask a question in Korean. There are also different types of question endings, let’s look at them one by one.  

 

2. Formal Question Ending: ㅂ/습니까? 

We learned the formal sentence ending Verb-ㅂ/습니다, but to create a question with this ending, it’s not enough to put a question mark at the end of the sentence. The ending should change its form from Verb-ㅂ/습니다 to Verb-ㅂ/습니까? 

 

Let’s compare the 요 ending sentence with ㅂ/습니다 ending sentence. 

아침을 먹었어요. – I had breakfast. 

아침을 먹었어요? – Did you have breakfast? 

아침을 먹었습니다. – I had breakfast. 

아침을 먹었습니까? – Did you have breakfast? 

 

한국을 좋아해요. – I like Korea. 

한국을 좋아해요? – Do you like Korea? 

한국을 좋아합니다. – I like Korea. 

한국을 좋아합니까? – Do you like Korea? 

 

미국인이에요. I am from the US.

미국인이에요? Are you from the US?

미국인입니다. I am from the US.

미국인입니까? Are you from the US?

*Verb-ㅂ/습니까 question ending is rarely used in daily conversations. It’s usually used in a formal setting. 

 

3. More Question Endings

There are diverse question endings in Korean. Let’s look at the most common of them one by one.

 

 A. General Questions

1) -가(요) / 나(요)? – These question ending does not add particularly special nuance to the question and mean basically the same thing as the normal sentence ending questions.

 

존댓말 :  

Adjective / 이다 + ㄴ/은 가요? 

Verb (Present and Past Tense)/Adjective (Past Tense) + 나요? 

 

반말:

Adj/Verb(stem) + ~니? 

 

For example: 

이다(to be) > 한국인인가요? = 한국인이에요? Are you Korean?

바쁘다 (to be busy – adj) > 요즘 바빠요? = 요즘 바쁜가요? Are you busy these days?

공부하다 (to study – verb) > 매일 공부해요? = 매일 공부하나요? Do you study every day?

왔다 (came) > 엄마가 왔나요? = 엄마가 왔어요? Did mom come?

잘 하다 (to do well) > 한국어 잘하니? = 한국어 잘해? Are you good at Korean? 

배고프다 (to be hungry) > 배고픈가요? = 배고파요? Are you hungry? 

피곤하다 (to be tired) > 피곤한가요? =피곤해요? Are you tired? 

재미있다* (to be fun) >  한국어는 재미있나요? = 한국어는 재미있어요? (반말: 한국어는 재미있니?) Is Korean fun?

*the adjectives which contain “~있다/없다” follow the verb’s rule 

한국어를 할 수 있어? Can you speak Korean? (반말)
=한국어를 할 수 있니? 

 한국어를 할 수 있어요? Can you speak Korean? (존댓말)
=한국어를 할 수 있나요?

 

B. Wondering 

2) Verb/Adjective + ~ㄹ/을까? 

3) Adjective + ㄴ/은 가? 

4) Verb + ~나? 

When the above question endings are used, the speaker is wondering if something is the case (usually to oneself or not expecting a response necessarily.) In this case, these are usually used in 반말. 

By now, you can notice that Adj-ㄴ/은가? and Verb-나? have two meanings : 1) general question 2) wondering to oneself (in this case, 반말 form)
 

For example: 

제프는 한국어를 잘 할까? – I’m wondering if Jeff is good at Korean. (= 제프는 한국어를 잘하나?)

학생들은 피곤할까? – I’m wondering if the students are tired. 

아빠는 자나? – I’m wondering if dad is sleeping. 

아이들은 잘 지내나? – I’m wondering if the children are doing well. 

날씨가 좋은가? – I’m wondering if the weather is good. 

 

C. Confirmation

5) Verb/Adjective + ~지(요)? : This question ending is used when the speaker is seeking confirmation of his question. It’s often translated as, “~, right?”
  

너 한국인이야. – You’re Korean. 

너 한국인이야?/ 너 한국인이니? – Are you Korean? 

너 한국인이지? – You’re Korean, right? 

 

피곤하니? – Are you tired? 

피곤하지(요)? – You’re tired, right? 

 

잘 지내니? – Are you doing well? 

잘 지내지(요)? – You’re doing well, right? 

 

한국어 재미있니? – Is Korean fun? 

한국어 재미있지(요)? – Korean is fun, right? 

지수 씨, 오늘은 쉴 거예요? Jisoo, will you take a rest today?

지수 씨, 오늘은 쉴 거죠*? Jisoo, you will take a rest today, right?

*~지요 can be abbreviated to ~죠 
 

 

 D. Suggestion 

6) ㄹ/을까(요)?, ~ㄹ/을래(요)?  : These question endings can also be used as a suggestion, meaning “Shall we/I…?” 
 

Formal: Verb + ~ㄹ/을까요?, ~ㄹ/을래요? 

Informal: Verb+ㄹ/을까?, Verb + ~ㄹ/을래? 

Whether the subject is I or We depends on the contex.

There are subtle differences between -ㄹ/을까 and -ㄹ/을래 endings, and we’ll learn more about this in the next coming courses.

 

공부할까? – Shall we study? 

(=공부할래?)

 

갈까? – Shall we go? 

(=갈래?) 

 

만날까? – Shall we meet?

      category: "B1",
      text:
          """In today’s lesson, you will learn how to say “with” and “and” using 하고, (이)랑 and 와/과. All these particles are interchangeable, and can mean both “with” or “and”. You can figure out which one it means from the context.

Let’s start with 하고.

    Noun 하고 – with / and noun

You add 하고 to a noun to mean «and Noun» or «with Noun».

For example:

친구하고 학교에 함께* 가고 있어요. – I’m going to school with my friend.

오늘 우리는 언니하고 아침을 만들었어요. – I cooked breakfast with my older sister today.

저는 커피하고 차를 좋아해요. – I like both coffee and tea.

우리는 삼겹살하고 김치를 저녁으로 먹었어요. – We ate Korean BBQ and Kimchi for dinner.

제가 가장 좋아하는 과목은 외국어하고 음악이에요. – My favorite school subjects are foreign languages and music.

*함께 or 같이 means “together,” and it is often used together with 하고, (이)랑, and 와/과 when it means “with”

 

    Noun (이)랑 – with / and noun

You add 이랑 to a noun that ends in a consonant, and 랑 to a noun ends in a vowel.

Let’s look at examples:

제 오빠는 배구랑 농구를 잘 해요. – My older brother is good at volleyball and basketball.

립스틱이랑 마스카라를 살 거예요. – I will buy lipstick and mascara.

핸드폰이랑 열쇠를 잃어버렸어요. – I’ve lost my phone and keys.

채소를 안 좋아하지만 토마토랑 감자를 가끔 먹어요. – I don’t like vegetables, but sometimes I eat tomatoes and potatoes.

아빠랑 밥을 같이 먹었어요. – I had a meal with dad.

 

    Noun 와/과 – with / and noun

This is the most formal way of saying «and Noun» or «with Noun», and is usually used in writing or formal settings.

You add 과 to a noun ending in a consonant and 와 to a noun ending in a vowel.

e.g.

A: 어떤 책을 좋아해요? – What books do you like?

B: 저는 소설과 추리소설만 읽어요. – I only read fiction and mystery.

 

우리와 같이 밥을 먹을래요? – Would you like to eat with us?

설탕과 소금은 건강에 안 좋아요. – Sugar and salt are bad for your health.

 

※You will also find sentences that use more than two particles among (이)랑, 와/과 and 하고.

e.g.
저는 가족하고 친구들이랑 생일을 축하했요. – I celebrated my birthday with my family and friends.

In the sentence above,  the noun“가족” is combined with ~하고 and followed by a noun, so the translation will be “Noun and Noun”. 친구들 is combined with ~이랑 and there is no connecting noun after it, so the translation is “with Noun”. 

가장 친한 친구하고 같이 미국과 캐나다를 여행하고 싶어요. – I want to travel to the US and Canada with my friend.

 

[Quick Summary]:

Noun + 하고

Noun + (final consonant) 이랑 / (vowel) 랑

Noun + (final consonant) 과 or / (vowel) 와""",

  Lesson(
      title: "Lesson 24. Noun 도, 또한 (also, as well, too, even)",
      category: "B1",
      text: """1. Noun + 도 + positive verb : also Noun / as well as Noun

Examples: 

A: 저는 액션 영화를 너무 좋아해요. – I liked action movies.

B: 저도요 / 나도 – Me too.

 

However, you cannot use 도 to connect two nouns to mean “and.” For that, (이)랑 / 하고  / 와/과 particles should be used. 

e.g.
엄마가 요리를 잘해요. 아빠도요. – My mom is good at cooking. My dad as well.

엄마가 아빠도 요리를 잘해요 (X)  엄마랑 아빠가 요리를 잘해요 (O) . – My mom and dad are good at cooking.

 

저는 오렌지를 많이 샀고 바나나도 많이 샀어요. – I bought a lot of oranges and bananas too.

저는 오렌지를 바나나도 많이 샀어요. (X) 저는 오렌지하고 바나나를 많이 샀어요. (O) – I bought a lot of oranges and bananas. 

 

Let’s look at more example sentences/dialogues using the particle 도. 

A: 수업 끝나고 밥 같이 먹을래요? – Shall we go to eat after class?

B: 지수도 가요? – Is Jisoo going too?

A: 네. – Yes.

B: 그럼 저도 갈게요! – Then I will too.

 

오늘도 비가 와요. – It’s raining today as well. (implies that it rained the previous day)

 

Note in the above sentences that you don’t need to put topic, subject or object particles (은/는, 이/가, 을/를) after 도.

[도 after subjects/topics]

저도 고양이를 좋아해요. – I also like cats.

그 학생도 수학을 잘 해요. – That student is also good at math.

내 남동생도 밥을 많이 먹었어. – My younger brother ate a lot too.

 

[도 after objects]

저는 고양이도 좋아해요. I like cats as well (as other animals.)

그 학생은 수학도 잘 해요. – That student is good at math as well (as other things.)

내 남동생은 밥도 많이 먹었어요. – My younger brother ate a lot of rice too (as well as other things.)

 

You can figure out whether the noun marked by 도 is a subject or object in a sentence, by context.

e.g.

A: 저는 겨울을 제일 좋아해요. – I like winter the most.
B: 저희 엄마도요. – My mom (likes winter the most) as well. – Subject.

A: 우리 반에서 지수만 A를 받았죠? – Jisoo was the only one who got an A in our class, right?
B: 지호도요. – Jiho (got an A) too. – Subject.

저는 강아지를 키워요. 고양이도요. – I have a dog. (I have) a cat as well. – Object.

저도 한국어를 공부해요. – I (in addition to other people who learn Korean) learn Korean too. – Subject.

저는 한국어도 공부해요. – I learn Korean too (in addition to other languages I learn). – Object.

제 친구도 춤을 잘 춰요. – My friend (in addition to other people) is good at dancing too. – Subject.

제 친구는 춤도 잘 춰요. – My friend is good at dancing too (in addition to the other things he is good at).  – Object.

저도 그 시험을 통과했어요. – I passed the exam too (in addition to other people who also passed it). – Subject.

저는 그 시험도 통과했어요. – I passed that exam too (in addition to other exams that I passed). – Object.

 

However, that doesn’t mean 도 cannot be used with any other particles. Except for topic/subject/object markers, it can follow other particles.

For example:

1) 나한테 (to/from me) > 나한테도 (to/from me as well)
지호가 어제 너한테 전화했어? 나한테도 전화했어. Did Jiho call you yesterday? He called me as well.

2) 주말에 (on the weekend) > 주말에도 (on the weekend as well)
저는 주말에도 시험 공부를 열심히 해야 돼요. – I have to study for the exam hard even on weekends.

3) 집에서 (at home) > 집에서도 (at home as well)
저는 잠을 좋아해요. 집에서도 잠만 자요. I like sleep. Even at home, all I do it sleep.

4) 친구랑 / 친구하고 / 친구와 (with a friend) > 친구랑도  / 친구하고도 / 친구와도 (with a friend as well)
어제 너무 외로워서 엄마랑 얘기했어요. 친구랑도요. I was feeling so lonely yesterday, so I talked with mom. Also with my friend. 

You can notice from the above sentences that you put 도 after the main particle.

(We’ll learn more in-depth about each particle used above (에, 에서, 한테) in the next coming lessons.)

 

*Another word with the same meaning as 도 would be 또한.

또한 means “also” or “in addition” and can be used after a noun, as well as after a whole sentence as a sentence connector.

It sounds more formal than 도, so it’s rarely used in spoken sentences.

e.g.

지수는 영어를 잘해요. 저 또한 잘해요. (=저도 잘해요.)  Jisoo speaks good English. I as well. 

날씨가 추워지고 있습니다. 또한 눈도 많이 내리고 있습니다. The weather is getting colder. In addition, snow is coming more often.

 

2. Noun + 도 + negative verb : not even noun 

저는 너무 가난해서 1000원도 없어요. I am so broke that I don’t even have 1000 won.

저는 너무 바빠서 전화도 못 받아요. I am too busy that I cannot even answer the phone.

  Lesson(
      title: "Lesson 25. 에 vs 에서 (Time & Place Marking Particles)",
      category: "B1",
      text:
          """에 and 에서 are both used as time particles and place particles, meaning both of them can be used after a time and a place noun. So, let’s dive into it and learn the differences.

 

1. 에 as a Time Particle

a) Specific Time

At 1 o’clock = 한 시에

 At 3 o’clock = 세 시에

 At 9 o’clock = 아홉 시에

 

 b) Time of the Day:

아침 (morning): 아침에 (in the morning)

저녁 (evening): 저녁에 (in the evening)

밤 (night): 밤에 (at night)

 

c) Day:

월요일 (Monday): 월요일에 (on Monday)

목요일(Thursday): 목요일에 (on Thursday)

일요일 (Sunday): 일요일에 (on Sunday)

에 can also be put after words like:

주말 (weekend): 주말에 (on the weekend)

주중 (weekdays): 주중에 (on weekdays)

 

d) Month:

1월 (January), 2월 (February), … 12월 (December)

1월에 = in January

2월에 = in February

저는 12월에 태어났어요. – I was born in December.

 

e) Year:

2020 년에 = in 2020

1992 년에 = in 1992

저는 1992년에 태어났어요. – I was born in 1992.

 

f) Season:

봄 (spring): 저는 봄에 제프를 만났어요. – I met Jeff in spring.

여름 (summer): 저는 여름에 수영해요. – I swim in summer.

가을 (fall): 가을에 (in fall)

겨울 (winter): 겨울 (in winter)

 

g) Special periods of time:

방학 (summer/winter vacation at school): 저는 방학에 여행을 했어요. – I traveled during the vacation.

쉬는 시간 (rest time): 저는 쉬는 시간에 낮잠을 잤어요. – I took a nap during the break time.

점심 시간 (lunch time): 점심 시간에 (during the lunch time)

저녁 시간 (dinner time): 저녁 시간에 (during dinner time)

 

*For months and years, Sino-Korean numbers are used.

**Such words as 오늘 (today), 내일 (tomorrow), 어제 (yesterday) are not followed by 에 (오늘에 would be wrong, etc).

 

2. 에서 as a Time Particle

As we know so far, Time Noun + 에 = at/during Time Noun.

But when we use 에서, it has a different meaning:

 

Time Noun¹ 에서 = from (time noun)

and usually it’s followed by another particle:

Time Noun² 까지 = to (time noun)

Together they mean “from (time) to (time)”.

Ex. 1시에서 2시까지 게임을 했어요. – I was playing games from 1 to 2.

Ex. 저는 매일 9시에서 6시까지 일해요. – I work from 9 to 6 every day.

 

When 에서 means “from” like in this case, it can be replaced with 부터 particle.

Ex. 1시부터 2시까지 게임을 했어요. – I was playing games from 1 to 2.

Ex. 저는 매일 9시부터 6시까지 일해요. – I work from 9 to 6 every day.

 

에서 vs 부터 when both mean “from”

They are in may cases interchangeably used; however, 에서 is more often used with “place,” and 부터 is more often used with “time.”

서울에서 부산까지 = From Seoul to Busan

한 시 부터 세 시까지 = From 1 o’clock to 3 o’clock 

 

3. Using 에 and 에서 as a Place Particle

1) The First Meaning

a) Place 에

Ex. 저는 도서관에 있어요. – I’m at the library.

Place 에 = in/at (place) (indicates the location of something/somebody’s presence)

: it’s always followed by a verb that means sth/sb’s presence

There are not many verbs which indicate presence, but here are some of the most commonly used:

있다 (to be): 저는 한국에 있어요. – I’m in Korea. / 저는 집에 있어요. – I’m at home.

살다 (to live): 저는 한국에 살아요. – I live in Korea.

(살다 can be used with both 에 and 에서, but 에 sounds more natural.)

존재하다 (to exist): 지구에 많은 생물체가 존재해요. – A lot of creatures exist on Earth.

출석하다 (to be present) *often used to indicate one’s presence at class

Ex. 오늘 과학 수업에 출석했어요. – I was (present) in a science class.

참석하다 (to be present) *often on an event/meeting

Ex. 많은 연예인들이 그 행사에 참석했어요. – A lot of celebrities were at this event.

 

b) Place 에서

Ex. 저는 도서관에서 공부해요. – I study in a library.

Place 에서 = in (place) (indicates the location of a specific action)

: it’s always followed by various specific action verbs:

Ex. 저는 집에서 공부해요. – I study at home.

Ex. 저는 한국에서 일해요. – I work in Korea.

Ex. 지수는 제프와 영화관에서 데이트를 해요. – Jisoo had a date with Jeff at the movie theater.

Ex. 저는 화장실에서 일을 봐요. – I’m in a bathroom. (화장실에서 일을 보다 is a soft way to say that you are peeing or pooping)

 

2) The second meaning of 에 and 에서 when used as place particle

Place Noun에 = to (place) *noun is the “heading point”

Place Noun 에서 = from (place) *noun is the “starting point”

 

Depending on the context and the following verb, it is easy to understand which meaning 에 or 에서 has.

There is a limited amount of verbs that can be used with 에 or 에서 having this meaning:

 

가다 (to go):

Ex. 저는 학교에 안 갔어요. – I didn’t go to school.

Ex. 엄마는 매일 병원에 가요. – My mom goes to the hospital every day.

 

오다 (to come):

Ex. 내일 우리 집에 와. – Come to my house tomorrow!

Ex. 파티에 왜 안 와? – Why don’t you come to parties?

 

도착하다 (to arrive):

*in Korean it is said “to arrive to (에) somewhere,” not at somewhere

Ex. 공항에 도착했어요. – I arrived at the airport.

Ex. 미국에 언제 도착해요? – When are you arriving to the US?

Ex. 어느 나라에서 왔어요? – Where are you from?

Ex. 학교에서 집으로 갔어요. – I went home from school. *to replace (으)로 with 에 in this case would be unnatural

 

cf) Shortened form of 에서

에서 can be shortened to 서 when it has any of the meanings described in the lesson (in, at, from).
* Both usages are correct, and Koreans tend to use a shortened form so a sentence sounds softer and friendlier.

Ex. 강남에서 마포까지 얼마나 걸려요? – How long does it take from 강남 to 마포?

= 강남서 마포까지 얼마나 걸려요?
*Place Noun¹ 에서 + Place Noun² 까지 = from (place¹) to (place²)


Ex. 사무실에서 일해요. – I work at the office.
= 사무실서 일해요.

Ex. 제프는 캐나다에서 왔어요. – Jeff came to Canada.

=제프는 캐나다서 왔어요.

 

★★★★★★★★★★

[Quick Summary]

  Lesson(
      title: "Lesson 26. Particle (으)로’s Many Usages",
      category: "B1",
      text:
          """In this lesson, we’re going to learn how to use (으)로 particle and its main usages.


Noun (ends in 받침) + 으로

Noun (doesn’t end in 받침) + 로


Ex. 학교 (school) > 학교로

집 (house) > 집으로

The only exception to this rule is when a noun ends in “ㄹ” 받침 then 로 is used.

Ex. 팔 (arm) > 팔로

 

So now, let’s find out how (으)로 can be used.

Usage #1: Direction

(으)로 can be followed by 7 main direction nouns.

오른쪽 = right 

*오른 (right), 쪽 (side)

왼쪽 = left

*왼 (left)

앞 = front

뒤 = back

위 = up

아래/밑 = down

Let’s look at some example sentences:

오른쪽으로 가세요. – Please, go right. (or, Go to the right side).

왼쪽으로 오세요. – Please, go left. (or, Go to the left side).

앞으로 가. – Go forward.

뒤로 와. – Come backward.

(위로) 올라와. – Come up.

(위로) 올라가. – Go upward. 

** 올라오다 = to come up; 올라가다 = to go up.

 (아래로) 내려와. – Come down.

(밑으로) 내려가. – Go down.

*** 내려오다 = to come down; 내려가다 = to go down.

 

Usage #2: “to” somewhere | (으)로 vs. 에

When you say “to (a place)”, both (으)로 and 에 are used, but they are not entirely the same. 

에 is used when somebody is getting somewhere itself, whereas, ~(으)로 implies that somebody is getting somewhere from somewhere else.

Let’s look at the examples:

저는 학교(에) 가요. – I go to school.

저는 집(에) 가요. – I go home.

어디에 가? = 어디 가? – Where are you going?

These sentences are focused on the heading point.

*~에 can be removed in all the examples above and would still have the same meaning.

 

As for ~(으)로, it’s not only focused on the heading point but also the starting point.

화장실에 가고 싶어요. – I want to go to the bathroom.

(여기에서) 어디로 가야 해요?* – (From here) to where do I have to go? 

*this sentence has a starting point indicated with 에서, so (으)로 sounds more natural. 

vs. 어디에 가야 해요? = Where do I have to go? > used to specifically ask about a heading point. 

 

Let’s look at other examples:

저는 경기도에서 서울로 통근해요. – I commute from Gyeonggi province to Seoul.

제프는 아침에 집에서 학교로 갔어. – Jeff went from home to school.

저는 (여기서*) 편의점으로 갈 거예요. – I will go from here to a convenience store.

*even though saying 에서 is more common, it can be shortened to 서 as in the example above. 

 

Usage #3: A means of transportation / a tool. 

    ~(으)로 can be used to mark the means of transportation and translates as “by”.

저는 지하철로 통근해요. – I commute by subway.

버스로 가자. – Let’s go by bus.

강남에서 경기도까지 버스로 한 시간 걸려요. – It takes one hour from 강남 to 경기도 by bus.

*Place Noun 에서 + Place Noun 까지 = From (place) To (place).

 

    To indicate a “tool” (translates as “with”).

연필로 썼어요. – I wrote it with a pencil. 

펜으로 쓰세요. – Please, write it with a pen. 

손으로 써. – Write it with your hand.

이거 발로 썼니? – Did you write it with your foot?

제프와 스카이프로 영상통화를 했어요. – I did a video call with Jeff by using Skype.

이거 뭐로 만들었어요? – With what did you make it?

 

Usage #4: Choice

First, let’s look at this example:

A: 이거랑 저거 예쁘다! 뭐로 살까? – They’re both pretty! Which one shall we buy?

*by saying “뭐로”, we indicate that we need to make choice.

B: 저거로 사자. – Let’s buy that one.

** we put “로” to “저거” to indicate a choice.

So, in this case, ~(으)로 particle is used to indicate a choice to be made among all the other options. 

 

Let’s look at other dialogues:

A: 어디(에) 갈까? – Where shall we go?

B: 공원(에) 가자! – Let’s go to the park!

A: 어디로 갈까? – Which park (among other parks) shall we go to?

B: 한남동으로 가자! – Let’s go to 한남동. 

 

One more:

A: 어떤 거로 드릴까요? – Which one shall I give (to you)?

B: 아메리카노로 주세요. – Americano, please.

B: 떡볶이로 주세요. – Give me 떡볶이, please.

 

Let’s summarize everything:

~(으)로 particle has four main usages:

Usage #1: Direction + ~(으)로

Usage #2: “Place + (으)로” to indicate a heading point, but also, implying the starting point.

Usage #3: “a mean of transportation/a tool + ~(으)로” to mean “by a transport/with a tool”.

Usage #4: “Noun of choice + ~(으)로 “to indicate your choice among the other choices""",

      title: "Lesson 27. How to say “You” in Korean",
      category: "B1",
      text: """As previously encountered, you can say “I/me” or “You” by using: 
 	I/me 	You 
반말 (informal) 	나 	너 
존댓말 (formal) 	저 	~ 

e.g., 너는 한국어를 공부해 – You study Korean 

 

However, we haven’t yet seen how to say “You” in formal language(존댓말).  

As Korean learners, the most commonly encountered way of saying “you” is by using 당신. 

This is as when using translators, since there are so many ways to say “you” and the translator doesn’t have enough context to be specific, 당신 is normally the result of many searches.   

However, 당신 is actually barely used in spoken Korean but can be used in specific contexts: 

 

1) Between married couples 

당신 is used to mean “you” between married couples when referring to your significant other 

Another commonly used word is 여보 which means “honey/dear” but this is closer to a term of endearment than 당신 

e.g., A: 미안해요, 여보 – I’m sorry honey  

        B: 당신이 뭐가 미안해요? – What are you sorry for? 

 

2) When using a negative tone 

The use of 당신 adds a hostile tone to your speech 

e.g., 당신 뭐야, 당신 의사 맞아? – What even are you, are you even a doctor? 

~This is used more in k-dramas/movies than in real life~ 

 

3) In writing when addressing an unspecific audience  

In books, ads and translations, 당신 is used as a way to address the audience universally as “You” 

This is useful since 당신 avoids adjusting the levels of formality when addressing different age groups which is normally necessary  

e.g., 당신은 뇌를 고칠 수 있다 – You Can Fix Your Brain (book title) 

You can think of this as saying “You” more generally than addressing a specific person 

 

4). When using a poetic/romantic tone  

Because of this, it is commonly seen in song lyrics and poetry.  

 

Outside of these specific contexts, the most commonly way to say “You” in is a Third-person form and there are 4 main ways to do this: 

All of these would be said directly to the person and thus by context come to mean “you.” 

 

    First name + 씨 / 님 

In Korean, it can be rude to only address someone by their first name especially when speaking in 존댓말 

Because of this, you can attach these endings to be more polite  

They act in a similar way to “Mr/Mrs” titles in English  

e.g., 내일 빅키님한테 전화 드릴게요 – I will give you (Vicky) a call tomorrow  

         내일 제프씨한테 전화 드릴게요 – I will give you (Jeff) a call tomorrow 

님 is higher in respect than 씨 and so normally used in cases when it is more relevant (e.g., with someone older or with a highly respected profession) 

 

NB: in cases where you want to use this, but you don’t know the person’s name you can ask by using: 

이름이 뭐예요? < 이름이 어떻게 되세요? < 성함이 어떻게 되세요? 

“What is your name?” (In order of increasing politeness) 

성함 is an honorific version of 이름 and so is the most polite form 

      2. 그쪽 

This is used with people you aren’t close to or in cases where you don’t know/are too shy to use the person’s name 

e.g., 그쪽 기다렸어요 – I waited for you  

However, this should NOT be used with people older than you  

 

     3. Social name*  

You can address the person based on their role in social contexts (e.g., family, school, work etc.) 

Some examples include 엄마 (mum), 선배 (senior), 사장님/대표님 (boss/CEO) 

e.g., 언니 보고 싶어 – I miss you (said to your older female family member/friend) 

It is also possible to attach 씨/님 after these social positions (e.g., 실장님/형님) 

e.g., 선배님 뭐 공부해요? – What are you studying? 

 

*Note: Some social names to take note of  
Title 	Meaning/Explanation 
선배and 후배 	

선배is a term used to refer to a person who joined an organisation/group before you. For example, if you joined a school in 2017, anyone who joined before this would be your 선배.  

Those who then joined after you (after 2017), could be referred to as your후배 
아저씨 	used for men who are older than you with larger age gaps (e.g., in their 30/40/50s) than those who you would call 오빠 
아주머니 and아줌마 	

used for middle-aged women but 아줌마 sounds slightly less friendly than 아주머니 (female equivalent of아저씨) 

 
아가씨 and총각 	

아가씨is used for younger unmarried females and총각is the equivalent for unmarried males (similar to bachelor/bachelorette) 

 
어머님and 아버님 	

can be used to refer to the parents of the people you know (e.g., friends or students’ parents) 

 
이모 and 고모 	

both mean “aunty” but 이모 refers to your aunt on your mum’s side, whereas 고모 refers to your aunt on your dad’s side  

 
언니 and 누나** 	

both mean “older sister” however 언니 is only said by females and 누나 is only said by males  

 
오빠 and 형** 	both mean “older brother” but only females would say 오빠 and males would say 형 

** These names are not only used for direct siblings but can also be used for older cousins, friends etc.   

 

    5. Job name + 님 (/선생님) 

Examples include 선생님 (teacher) 의사 (doctor) 기사 (driver) 기자 (journalist) 작가 (writer) 

E.g., 저는 작가님의 팬이에요 – I’m your fan (said to a writer) 

         저는 선생님께 감사해요 – I am thankful for you (said to teacher) 

~since 선생님 already ends in 님, you don’t need to add another~ 

Attaching 선생님 is more respectful and is not only used after job titles but can also be added to first names or last names.  

e.g. 저는 빅키 선생님과 수업을 할 거예요. I will have a class with Teacher Vicky.

 

For some professions, 선생님 is attached more commonly than 님 and 의사 (doctor) is an example of this  

e.g., 저는 의사 선생님을 믿어요 – I trust you (said to your doctor) 

 

If ever in doubt, it is possible to completely remove the subject since it should still be understood by context that you are talking/referring to someone.""",

      title: "Lesson 28. How to say “He, She, They” in Korean",
      category: "B1",
      text: """Pronouns (대명사) 

Pronouns are used when you are referring back to someone you have mentioned in a previous sentence, in place of repeating their name (e.g., I know Sara. She is smart). 

 

As always, in Korean, these pronouns can be removed if the individual is clear from context. 

e.g., 저는 남동생이 있어요. (-) 열 세살이에요 – I have a younger brother. He is 13 years old.  

 

However, if you want to include them, there are many possible ways this can be achieved: 

 

1. Dictionary Forms 

These are barely used in spoken Korean since they have a romantic/serious tone  

They include: 

그 → he/him  

그녀 → she/her  

그들 → they/them  

 

2. More common forms 

In spoken Korean, the pronoun 그 애 is more commonly used than the above dictionary forms.  

This literally translates to “that person I know/that person we are talking about.” 

Therefore, it can refer back to the subject previously spoken about and can be used for both genders. 

e.g., 저는 사라를 알아요. 그 애는 똑똑해요 – I know Sara. She is smart.  

 

This pronoun is also commonly shortened to 걔. 

 

Following the same rules, the modifiers 이 and 저can be used with 애. 

For example: 

그 애 → that person – – > 걔 

이 애 → this person – – > 얘 

저 애 → that person – – > 쟤* 

 

*Note: the difference between 저 애 and 그 애 is that 저 애 specifically means “that person (over there)” and so is mainly used to refer to someone relatively far away but still in sight. However, 그 애 can be used to refer to someone that isn’t present/in sight.  

e.g., 쟤가 걔야? – Is that person (over there) the person we know(we talked about)? / Is she her? 

 

Example sentences:  

쟤 제프 아니야? – Isn’t that (person over there) Jeff? 

지수는 남자친구가 있어. 걔 알아? – Jisoo has a boyfriend. Do you know him? 

차 키 얘한테 줬어요 – I gave the car keys to him/her** 

 

**Note: Notice how the same pronouns can be used regardless of whether the person is a subject or an object unlike English where there are two different words (she/her, he/him) 

 

Since 걔, 쟤 and 얘 are all 반말, they can NOT be used when referring to someone who you should be paying respect to. 

The 존댓말versions of 그 애 are: 

그 분 → that person 

이 분 → this person 

저 분 → that person (over there) 

*where 분 is the honorific form of 사람* 

 

e.g., 이 분이 우리 엄마야 – She is my mum 

         제프는 형이 있어요. 그 분은 친절하세요 – Jeff has an older brother. He is kind.  

 

To then pluralise these pronouns and form “they”, you just need to add the particle -들 

 

For example: 
반말 (informal) 	존댓말 (formal) 
얘들 (or 얘네들)	이 분들 
걔들 (or 걔네들)	그 분들 
쟤들 (or 쟤네들)	저 분들 

 

Example: 

그 분들은 모두 친절해요 – all of them are kind***  

이 분들은 제 선배예요 – these people are my seniors 

저 분들은 어느 나라 사람이에요? – which country do they come from? 

 

***It is possible to add 모두 or 다 after the pronouns to create the meaning “all of them” 

These two words can also be used instead of the pronouns or together in the same sentence (e.g., 모두 다) to create this meaning  

e.g., 저는 그 분들 모두 다 좋아요 / 저는 모두 좋아요– I like all of them. 

 

 

3. More ways to make pronouns

You can also put a noun after the modifiers그/이/저 to create a pronoun (e.g., 이 선생님, 그 친구) 

e.g., 이 여자는 행복해요 – She (this woman) is happy  

         저 학생의 피부가 너무 좋아요! – Her (that student’s) skin is so good! 

 

4. What to do if these aren’t appropriate 

 

In some cases where levels of formality can be a slightly grey area, 걔/그 분 can sound slightly strange (e.g., with older siblings/family) 

For example, when referring to an older sibling, since they are older, the 반말 form 걔 is not appropriate but since 그 분 is an honorific form, it may sound as though you are putting distance between them and yourself  

If this is the case, it is better to refer to them by their third person pronoun.   

e.g., 

저는 언니가 세명 있어요. 언니들은 친절해요 – I have three older sisters. They are kind.  

저는 언니가 세명 있어요. 모두 친절해요 – I have three older sisters. They are all kind. 

 

More example sentences  

 

A: 지수가 어떻게 A를 받았어요? – How did Jisoo get an A? 

B: 걔 공부를 되게 열심히 했어요 – She studied really hard  

 

빅키 선생님은 한국어를 가르쳐요. 저는 그 선생님의 수업이 좋아요 – Miss Vicky teaches Korean. I like her class. 

 

스미스씨는 제 이웃이에요. 그 분은 매우 웃기세요 – Mr Smith is my neighbour. He is very funny.""",

      title: "Lesson 2. How to say, “I can” and “I can’t”",
      category: "B2",
      text:
          """There are 2 main ways you can express your ability/inability to do something in Korean:

1. VERB STEM + ㄹ/을 수 있어요/없어요
2. 못 + VERB, VERB STEM + 지 못해요 [못 (adv.) = can’t]

3. VERB STEM + ㄹ/을 줄 알아요/몰라요

These constructions can be used to mean “I can” or “I can’t”; however they can indicate slightly different things.

1. VERB STEM + ㄹ/을 수 있다/없다

 

When using this construction, you imply your ability to do something is either physically, legally or circumstantially possible/impossible.
(It is also sometimes used when talking about your proficiency/skill in something (e.g. I can speak Korean 한국어를 할 수 있어요, I can’t play flute etc 플룻을 불 수 없어요,) but it is still unclear as to whether that’s grammatically correct. But one thing for sure is that there are more natural sounding patterns to talk about your proficiency/skill (or lack thereof), which we’ll learn in this lesson.)

The construction is used as follows:
 	I can	I can NOT
With 받침	Verb stem + 을 수 있다	Verb stem + 을 수 없다
Without 받침	Verb stem + ㄹ 수 있다	Verb stem + ㄹ 수 없다

can be conjugated into different tenses as necessary

Examples

I can eat slowly because I’m not late – 안 늦어서 천천히 먹을 수 있어요.

I got my driver’s license yesterday. I can drive now. – 어제 운전 면허를 땄어요. 이제 운전할 수 있어요 (=운전을 할 수 있어요). 

I can’t do everything for you – 제가 모두 다 해줄 수가 없어요.*

I was too busy watching the kids, so I couldn’t cook. – 저는 아이들 보느라 바빠서 요리를 할 수 없었어요.

*It is also possible to see the 이/가 particle added to form 수가 있다/없다 which has the same meaning but adds a slight emphasis. It can be thought of as saying “I can’t even…”.

Much like this, the 은/는 particle can be added to imply a contrast, forming 수는 있다/없다. For example, 여기에서 잘 수는 없어요 – I can’t sleep here (but I may be able to sleep somewhere else, or I may be able to do other things here than sleep).

 

2. 못 + VERB, VERB STEM + 지 못하다

There’s another construction you can use when expressing you CANNOT do something or something’s not possible :

못 + VERB (more common)

or, VERB STEM + 지 못하다 (slightly more formal)

→ These are interchangeable

Verb-ㄹ/을 수 없다 can be replaced with 못+verb and it will still mean the same thing; in other words, Verb+ㄹ/을 수 없다 and 못+Verb does not have a very significant difference.

However, when talking about your lack of skill or proficiency in something, 못+verb sounds more natural.

This is because 못+verb implies that you are unable to do something for a wider variety of reasons, including the lack of skill or proficiency, physicality or circumstances.  

*TIP: When you are in doubt whether to use -ㄹ/을 수 없어요 or 못+verb / verb+지 못해요, you can go with 못+verb / verb+지 못해요 and it will sound natural most of the time. 

 

Examples

수영할 수 없어요 – I can’t swim (because I physically can’t).
= 수영하지 못해요 / 수영 못해요* – I can’t swim (it could be either I physically can’t or I don’t want my hair to get wet etc.)
*Note: When 못 is combined with 하다 to mean lack of skill, it has to be attached (못하다(O) – without space in between.) However, when 못 is combined with other verbs to mean lack of skill, they have to be spaced. 

피아노를 못 쳐요 – I can’t play piano (because I lack the skill, It’s late at night, I should not disrupt my neighbor etc.)

볼 수 없어요 – I can’t see (because sth isn’t there anymore).
vs. 보지 못해요 / 못 봐요 – I can’t see (because someone’s head is in the way, because I’m not allowed to, because I’m short-sighted etc)

Note: In Korean, it is more common to use the verb 보이다 (to be seen/visible) when saying if you can/cannot see something. The same idea is seen for the verb 들리다 (to be heard/audible).

e.g., 나 보여? – Can you see me? (/am I visible?).

         안 보여 – No I can’t see. 

        제 목소리가 들리시나요? – Can you hear me? (/is my voice audible?)

자가 격리 중이라서 못 나가요. I can’t go out because I am in quarantine. 

 

2. VERB STEM + ㄹ/을 줄 알아요/몰라요

 

This construction can also indicate your ability/skill to do something but it is slightly different to-ㄹ/을 수 있다/없다 since it is closer to implying whether you have LEARNT how to do something or not. For example, in English, this would be the difference between saying “I cannot drive” and “I know how to drive”. This is why 알다 (to know) and 모르다 (to not know) are seen in these constructions. However, because this can still indicate your ability, it is commonly also translated as, “I can” and “I cannot”.

The construction is used as follows:
 	I know how to	I do NOT know how to
With 받침	Verb stem + 을 줄 알다	Verb stem + 을 줄 모르다
Without 받침	Verb stem + ㄹ 줄 알다	Verb stem + ㄹ 줄 모르다

can be conjugated into different tenses as necessary

Examples

I know how to compliment in Korean – 저는 한국말로 칭찬할 줄 알아요. (칭찬하다: to compliment)

I don’t know how to make kimchi fried rice – 저는 김치볶음밥을 만들 줄 몰라요.

Can you speak English? – 영어를 할 줄 아세요?

Do you know how to open the water bottle? – 물 병을 열 줄 알아?

I can drive. – 운전할 줄 알아요.

 

 

Irregular forms to note

    When irregular verbs with ㄷ 받침 are combined with these constructions, the ㄷ becomes a ㄹ to help with pronunciation.

듣다 → 들을 수 있어요 – I can hear.

    When verbs with ㄹ 받침 are combined with these constructions, no extra ㄹ or 을 needs to be added.

울다 → 울 수 없어요 – I can’t cry

만들다 → 만들 줄 알다 – I know how to make

    When irregular verbs with ㅅ 받침 are combined with these constructions, the ㅅ 받침 is removed before the 을 is added.

낫다 → 감기가 나을 수 있어요 – Your cold can get better

    When irregular verbs with ㅂ 받침 are combined with these constructions, the verb stem loses its ㅂ and has a 우 added before it is combined with the construction.

무섭다(to be scary) → 무서울 수 없어요 – It can’t be scary.

 

Summary and example of the key differences
I can 	Verb stem + ㄹ/을 수있다	Physical/circumstantial ability	수영할 수 있어요	I can swim (because I am physical able to swim)
 	Verb stem + ㄹ/을 줄알다	Indicates you have learnt how to do something	수영할 줄 알아요	I know how to swim (because I was taught when I was younger)
I can not 	Verb stem + ㄹ/을 수없다	Physical/circumstantial inability	수영할 수 없어요	I cannot swim (because I’ve broken my arm)
 	못 + verb / verb stem + 지 못하다	Inability due to a variety of possibilities (not much difference from -ㄹ/을 수 없다 and often interchangeable, except when expressing lack of skills)	수영하지 못해요 /수영 못해요	I can’t swim (because I don’t want to get my hair wet, I lack the skill etc.)
 	Verb stem + 줄 모르다	Indicates you have not learnt how to do something	수영할 줄 몰라요	I do not know how to swim (because I was never taught)""",

      category: "B2",
      text:
          """These particles can be put after a noun that identifies a person or an animal, as well as plural nouns.

에게, 한테 and 께 have the same meanings, whereas 께서, has a different one.

Both 께 and 께서 are particles in honorific form.

Now, let’s look at the first usage of 에게 and 한테.

 

    When 에게 and 한테 mean “to” 

    First, here are some examples:

제프에게 선물을 줬어요. – I gave (to) Jeff a present.

누구한테 말했어요? – To whom did you tell/speak?

고양이한테 밥을 줬어요. – I gave a meal to a cat. (or, I fed a cat).

거지에게 돈을 줬어요. – I gave money to a beggar.

 

    When 에게 and 한테 mean “from”

 제프에게 선물을 받았어요. – I received a present from Jeff. 

*받다 (to receive) gives a context to translate 에게 as “from”, whereas, in the similar example above it was “to,” because “주다(to give)” verb gives a context of “giving sth to.”

누구한테 들었어요? – Who did you hear it from?

고양이한테 맞았어요. – I was beaten by (from) a cat.

누구에게 돈을 빌렸어요? – From whom did you borrow money?

As such, just by looking at the verb’s meaning, you can guess the meaning of 에게 and 한테.

 

    께 : A particle that means “to” and “from,” and it’s an honorific form of “에게 /한테”  

께 is an honorific form of 에게 and 한테, so the preceding noun that comes before 께, should be a noun to whom you show respect.

선생님께 드렸어요. – I gave it to the teacher. (=  less polite form: 선생님에게 줬어요.)

*note that 드리다 is an honorific form of 주다.

선생님께 받았어요. – I received it from the teacher. 

할머니께 전화했어요. – I called (to) my grandmother.

할머니께 전화를 받았어요. – I received a call from my grandmother. 

** depending on the verb that follows 께 particle, you can guess if it’s “to” or “from”.

 

    께서: Subject Marking Particle in Honorific form

Even though 께 and 께서 look similar, they have different meanings. Now we know that 께 can be used as a particle to mean “to” or “from”.

How about 께서?

께서 is an honorific form of “이/가” subject particles.

The honorific form of “은/는” would be 께서는.

If the subject of a sentence is someone you have to/want to show respect to, you should use the honorific forms of particles.

Let’s look at some examples:

할아버지께서 편찮으세요. – My grandfather is sick.

선생님께서 예쁘세요. – The teacher is pretty.

교수님께서 저에게 주셨어요*. – The professor gave it to me.
*along with the honorific subject marking particle, the “~(으)세요” honorific verb ending is used.

 

Now, let’s look at some extra examples:

그 영화는 많은 사람들에게 감동을 줍니다. – That movie gives inspiration to many people.

의사 선생님께서* 저한테 약을 주셨어요. – The doctor gave medicine to me.
*께서 honorific marking particle is used.

할머니한테(or 께) 혼났어요. – I was scolded (from) by my grandmother. (My grandmother scolded me).

이 목걸이 누구한테 받았어? – From whom did you receive/get this necklace?

남자친구한테 받았어. – I got it from my boyfriend.

엄마한테 말하지마. – Don’t tell (to) mom.

아무한테도 말하지마. – Don’t tell (to) anyone.

제프가 지수에게 청혼했어요. – Jeff proposed to Jisoo.

지수가 제프에게 청혼받았어요. – Jisoo received a proposal from Jeff.

 

    When 에게 should be replaced with 에

에게, 한테 and 께 can only be used after a noun that is a person or an animal.


When we talk about an organization, 에 is used.

학교에 말했어요. – I told it to school.

희사에 이메일을 보냈어요. – I sent an email to a company.

경찰에 신고했어요. – I reported to the police.

      category: "B2",
      text:
          """In today’s lesson, we’re going to learn two ways to say only, using 만(only) and 밖에(nothing but.) 

Let’s get started.

 

    만 Particle and its meaning : “only”

만 is a particle that is used to mean “only” or “just” and is added directly to a noun to get the meaning of “only Noun”.

Noun + 만: Only Noun

                                                                                                

For example:

저는 사과만 먹어요. – I eat only apples.

그 학생만 숙제를 했어요. – Only that student did the homework.

 

Depending on the position of 만 in a sentence, it can have be either subject or object. For example:

지수만 매운 음식이 좋아요. – Only Jisoo likes spicy food. (만 is placed after a subject.)

지수는 매운 음식만 좋아요. – Jisoo likes only spicy food. (만 is placed after an object.)

 

 

저만 한국어를 공부해요. – Only I learn Korean. (만 is placed after a subject.)

저는 한국어만 공부해요. – I learn only Korean.(만 is placed after an object.)

 

Note that you don’t need put additional subject or object particles(은/는, 이/가, 을/를) when using 만. If you do so, you put extra emphasis on the noun you add ~만 to.

e.g.
이 일은 저만 할 수 있어요. (O) – Only I can do this work.

이 일은 저만이 할 수 있어요. (O) – Only I can do this work. (Puts more emphasis.)

 

우리 가족은 엄마만 요리를 할 수 있어요. (O) – In my family, only my mom can cook.

우리 가족은 엄마만이 요리를 할 수 있어요. (O) – In my family, only my mom can cook. (Pusts more emphasis.)

 

나는 너만 사랑해. (O) – I only love you.
나는 너만을 사랑해. (O) – I only love you. (Puts more emphasis.)

 

만 can also be attached after other particles, like 에게, 한테, (으)로, 에서, 에, 동안 etc.

e.g.
엄마가 선물을 저한테만 줬어요. Mom gave the gift only to me.

저는 여섯 시에만 공부해요. I study only at 6 o’clock.

저는 도서관에 십 분 동안만 있었어요. I was at the library for only ten minutes.

저는 침대에서만 자요. I only sleep in bed.

 

    ~밖에

 

밖 means “outside” and 밖에 means “outside of something.”

밖에 is also a particle that means “nothing but.”

 

A. The first meaning of ~밖에 is “outside” 

날씨가 더워서 밖에 안 가요. – I won’t go outside because it’s hot.

저는 집 밖에 있어요. – I’m outside the house.

밖에 가고 싶지 않아요. – I don’t want to go outside.

 

B. The second meaning of ~밖에 is “only” or to be more precise “nothing but”. It has to be followed by a negative verb.

 

가족 밖에 > nothing but family 

돈 밖에 > nothing but money

문제 밖에 > nothing but problems

 

만 and 밖에 can be interchangeably used to mean “only,” except that for 밖에, a negated verb has to follow.

Noun + 밖에 + Negative Verb: Only Noun / Nothing but Noun

 

There are different ways to negate a verb : 

안 + Verb

Verb Stem + ~지 않다

 

저는 물만 마셔요. – I drink only water.

= 저는 물밖에 안 마셔요. / 저는 물밖에 마시지 않아요. – I only drink water.

 

아빠는 김치만 좋아해요. Dad only likes Kimchi.

= 아빠는 김치밖에 안 좋아해요. Dad only likes Kimchi.

 

*There are verbs that don’t follow the same verb negation rule, and have their own negative forms:

있다 (to have) > 없다 (not to have)   [안 있다 (X)]

알다 (to know) >모르다 (not to know)   [안 알다 (X)]

잘하다 (to do well) > 못하다 (to do poorly) [안 잘하다 (X)]

 

김치 밖에 없어요. – There’s only kimchi or There’s nothing but kimchi. (=김치만 있어요.)

저는 모국어 밖에 못해요. – I can only speak my mother tongue well. (=저는 모국어만 잘해요.)

그 사람 밖에 몰라요. – He/She is the only person I know. (=그 사람만 알아요.)

Noun + 만: Only Noun

 

Noun + 밖에 = Outside of Noun

Noun + 밖에 + Negative Verb: Only Noun / Nothing but Noun""",

  Lesson(
      title: "Lesson 5. What are Imperative Sentences?",
      category: "B2",
      text:
          """You will hear the term “imperative mood” used a lot in Korean grammar lessons. So what exactly is it?

Sentences in imperative mood, i.e, imperative sentences, refer to any sentence where you directly tell the other person/people to do or not do something. It could be a command, request, advice, encouragement, suggestion, recommendation etc.

Some examples of imperative sentences in English would be, 

“Clean the toilet.”

“Call me.”

“Cheer up.”

“Don’t eat too much.”

“Pass me the salt.”

“Please be on time.”

“Read this book when you have time because it’s so good.”

 

The similarity between Korean imperative sentences and English ones would be that a present-tense verb is directly used without attaching any auxiliary verbs like could you? would you? etc. 

“Clean the toilet.” = 화장실 청소해.

“Call me.” = 전화해요.

“Cheer up.” = 힘내세요.

“Don’t eat too much.” = 너무 많이 먹지 마요*. (*How to say, “Don’t” will be covered in Lesson 29 of Beginner 2.)

“Pass me the salt.” = 소금 좀 주세요.

“Please be (=come) on time.” = 늦지 않게 오세요.

“Read this book when you have time because it’s so good.” = 이 책 재미있으니까 꼭 읽어요. 

 

Imperative sentences in Korean aren’t necessarily impolite, and there are many ways to make these sentences sound polite by using different verb forms. 

One most common way is using the verb’s honorific form.

Every verb can have its honorific form, usually by adding –시다 after a verb’s stem. Considering its nature, honorific verb is almost always used in 존댓말, unless you’re being sarcastic. In 존댓말 ending, 시다 is conjugated to “-세요.” 

In the next two lessons, we will learn more in-depth abut these honorific verbs, including how to conjugate & use them appropriately in your sentences. """,

  Lesson(
      title: "Lesson 6. Verb’s honorific form #1 (-세요 ending, -시다 verb)",
      category: "B2",
      text: """n Korean, we have Formal and Informal ways of speaking. 

반말 = Informal language & 존댓말 = Formal language. 

존댓말 is used when speaking to someone who you need to show respect towards. As learnt earlier, adding -요 ending makes the sentence formal. However, in certain situations a more polite form of speech can be used. 

This is the ‘-세요’ form. 

 

PART I- ‘-(으)세요’ ending: 

This form is attached to the end of a verb or adjective in Korean to show respect or courtesy towards the subject of the sentence.  

Ex. 제프씨는 한국어 잘해요?  = Is Mr. Jeff good at Korean? ↓

     제프씨는 한국어 잘하세요?  = Is Mr. Jeff good at Korean? (politer towards Mr. Jeff) 

Ex. 제프씨의 어머니는 한국어 잘하세요?  = Is Mr. Jeff’s mother good at Korean? 

 

Attaching ‘-(으)세요’ to a verb (or adjective): 

If the Verb Stem does not end in 받침, simply add ‘-세요’ 

Ex. 공부하다 (to study) → 공부하세요.  

If the Verb Stem does end in 받침, add ‘-으세요’ 

Ex. 앉다 (to sit) → 앉으세요.  

For 이다 (to be) verb: –세요/–이세요. 

Ex. 지수씨는 선생님이세요? = Is Ms. Jisoo a teacher?  (ending in 받침) 

   아니요, 의사세요 = No, (she is) a doctor.  (not ending in 받침) 

‘-(으)세요’ ending can be used when the Subject of the sentence is either: 

You (2nd person) 

A 3rd person. 

*This ending can never be used when the subject is ‘I’ i.e. when the speaker is talking about him/herself! 

 

 

When the Subject is “You”- 

In such cases, the subject in a sentence can be omitted and assumed to be You (the other person). 

Ex. 예쁘세요 = You are pretty.  (예쁘다 = to be pretty) 

Ex. 커피 한 잔 주세요 = Please give me a cup of coffee.  (주다 = to give) 

It is more natural to omit the pronoun for ‘You’. 

When the Subject is a 3rd person- 

In such cases, the subject in a sentence is not to be omitted. It is exclusively mentioned. 

Ex. 저희* 어머니는 바쁘세요 = My mother is busy.  (*저희 is a politer form of 저의 meaning my; our) 

Ex. 지수 선배는 똑똑하세요 = My senior Jisoo is smart. 

 

Using ‘-(으)세요’  in an Imperative mood (for requests, suggestions, commands): 

Ex. 

Close your eyes = 눈을 감으세요. 

Do it quickly! = 빨리 하세요! 

Give me some water = 물 좀 주세요. 

 

Certain verbs have their own separate Honorific Forms: 

Ex. 

Base Verb 
	

Honorific Base Verb form 

먹다 (to eat) 
	

드세요 

아프다 (to sleep) 
	

편찮으세요 

자다 (to sleep) 
	

주무세요 

말하다 (to speak; talk) 
	

말씀하세요 

있다 (to be; have) 
	

계세요 

 

 

What we’ll learn in PART II: ‘-시다’ form: 

‘-세요’ is the Present form of the base verb ‘-시다’ 

Ex.  

이다 (to have; exist) → 이시다. 

오다 (to come) → 오시다. 

가다 (to go) → 가시다. 

웃다 (to laugh) → 웃으시다. 

만들다 (to make) → 만드시다*. 

울다 (to cry) → 우시다*. 

* 만들다, 울다 are Irregular verbs! When a verb contains ‘ㄹ’ 받침, it is deleted and then 시다 is added. """,

This form is used when you intend to show respect towards the Subject of the sentence. 

Ex. 우리 할머니께서* 곧 집에 오실 거예요 = My grandmother will come home soon. 

*께서 is the Honorific Particle form i.e. a more polite form of the Subject-marking Particles 이/가. 

 

Following are few examples of Regular Base Verbs in Korean and their Honorific Base Verb counterparts: 

Ex. 

이다 (to have; exist) → 이시다. 

오다 (to come) → 오시다. 

가다 (to go) → 가시다. 

웃다 (to laugh) → 웃으시다. 

울다 (to cry) → 우시다*. 

친절하다 (to be kind) → 친절하시다. 

 

CONJUGATING HONORIFIC BASE VERBS IN PAST TENSE: 

Conjugating Honorific Base Verbs in Past tense is the same as conjugating regular verbs whose verb stem ends in ‘ㅣ’ vowel in the Past tense. 

Ex. 마시다 (to drink) = 마셨어. 

Ex. 만지다 (to drink) = 만졌어. 

 

CONJUGATING HONORIFIC BASE VERBS IN FUTURE TENSE: 

Just like the Past Tense, Conjugating Honorific Base Verbs in Future tense is the same as conjugating regular verbs whose verb stem ends in ‘ㅣ’ vowel in the Future tense. 

Ex. 마시다 (to drink) = 마실 거예요. 

Ex. 만지다 (to drink) = 만질 거예요. 

 

When Honorific Base Verbs are conjugated in Present Tense, they utilise the previously learnt ‘-세요’.

There are also verbs (most notably, 있다 and 주다) that have TWO honorific forms and are used in different context.

있다 Verb in Honorific Form: 

있다 Verb has several meanings in Korean.  


1. 있다 when it means ‘to stay’ in a sentence, 

있다 → 계시다. 

Ex. 안녕히 계세요 = Goodbye. 

(Here 안녕히 계세요 literally means: ‘stay/be peacefully.’) 

Ex. 제프의 아버지는 집에 계세요 = Jeff’s father is home. 

2. 있다 when it means ‘to have’ in a sentence, 

있다 → 있으시다*. 

*Note that 계시다 cannot be used in this context! 

Ex. 남자친구 있으세요? = Do you have a boyfriend? 

 

주다 Verb in Honorific Form: 

주다 Verb when used in Honorific Form is used in the 2 below ways: 

1. 주시다 : used to show respect to the giver. 

Ex. 커피 한 잔 주세요 = Please give me a cup of coffee. 

Ex. 저한테 주세요 = Please give it to me.

Ex. 선생님께서 저희에게 주셨어요. = The teacher gave it to us.

 

2. 드리다 : used to show respect to the receiver.

Verb/Adj-겠어(요)/-겠습니다

 

Following are its usages:

1) Firm Will or Determination.

In this context, the Subject can only be First-person subjects i.e., ‘I’ or ‘we’.

4) Rhetorical question of something that is obviously not true.

Ex. – 지수 씨, 배 안 고파요? = Miss Jisoo, aren’t you hungry?

       – 아까 점심을 그렇게 많이 먹었는데 배가 고프겠어요? = Just earlier I ate so much, how can I be hungry?

Ex. 지금 너무 피곤해서 좀 쉴게. 이따가 얘기하자 = I’m very tired so I’m going to rest a bit. Let’s talk a little later.

Ex. 이 문법이 이해가 안 가요? 제가 설명해드릴게요. = You don’t understand this grammar? Let me explain.

 

3. Verb-ㄹ/을래(요):

The subject always has to be ‘I’ or ‘We,’ and it can also be used interchangeably with the Verb-ㄹ/을 거예요 i.e., the standard future form.

Following are its usages:

1) Informing your choice/decision (casual decision):

Ex. 나는 안 갈래 = I won’t go.

Ex. 그냥 포기 할래요 = I’ll just give up.

Ex. 오늘 저녁 안 먹을래요 = I won’t eat dinner today.

Ex. 오늘은 집에서 쉴래요? = Do you want to rest at home today?

Ex. 제가 키우는 고양이 사진 볼래요? = Would you like to see my cat’s photo?

 

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN –겠습니다 and –을래요 when talking about your decisions:

-겠습니다 form is used in more serious contexts and -ㄹ/을래요 form can be used while making decisions in your everyday casual situations.

 

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN –을래요and –을게요 when informing someone about something that I will do:

-을게요 is used in situations where you feel like the listener has to know about the information; when you’re being considerate towards the listener.""",

      title:
          "Lesson 9. How to say “than noun” : Making Comparison [noun 보다, 더(more), 덜(less)]",
      category: "B2",
      text:
          """In today’s lesson, we’re going to learn how to make comparative sentences in Korean.

First of all, we need to know what comparatives are.

To make an adjective / verb in a comparative form in English, it goes like this :

easy – easier (you add ~er ending to an adjective)

calm – calmer

beautiful – more beautiful (you add more before an adjective)

study – study more 

like – like more

 

You then add “than” before the noun that is being compared to. 

For example:

Korean food is spicier than Japanese food. – 한국 음식이 일본 음식보다 더 매워요.

I studied more than yesterday. – 어제보다 더 (많이) 공부했어요.

 

Now let’s learn specifically how a comparative sentence in Korean works. 

 

1. Particle “보다” (than, compared to)

보다 is a particle that corresponds to “than” in a comparative sentence.

Let’s look at some examples:

오늘은 어제보다 더 더워요. – Today is hotter than yesterday.

엄마는 아빠보다 요리를 더 잘해요. – My mom is better at cooking than my dad.

제 오빠는 저보다 키가 더 커요. – My older brother is taller than me.

저는 책 읽는 거보다 영화를 보는 걸 더 좋아해요. – I like watching movies more than reading books.

제 친구보다 밥을 더 먹었어요. – I ate more than my friend.

보다(than) is a particle, so you need to add it after a noun that is being compared to.

 

   2. Adverb “더” (more)

“더” is an adverb that means “more,” and you can put it before an Adjective, Adverb or Verb.

It is acceptable to omit 더 if it’s followed by an adjective or adverb and the comparative particle “보다” is already in the sentence. This is because it’s obvious that you’re making comparison and which one is more.

Noun + 보다 + 더 + Adjective / Adverb + Verb : Verb/Adjective/Adverb more than Noun

 

1) 더 + Adjective

아름답다 (to be beautiful) > 더 아름다워요 > more beautiful

맵다 (to be spicy) > 더 매워요 > spicier

쉽다 (to be easy) > 더 쉬워요 > easier

귀엽다 (to be cute) > 더 귀여워요 > cuter

건강하다 (to be healthy) > 더 건강해요 > healthier

 

2) 더 + (Adverb) + Verb 

: when 더 comes right before a verb, it’s usually because the adverb is omitted. 

The most common adverbs that are used with “더” are 많이 (a lot), 자주(often), and 오래(for a long time).

These adverbs can be omitted, but doesn’t always have to, especially if you’re trying to put emphasis.

저는 앞으로 책을 더 (많이)* 읽을 거예요. – From now on, I’m going to read more books.

저는 우리 가족을 더 (자주) 볼 거예요. – I will see my family more often.

어제보다 더 (오래)** 공부했어요. – I studied for a longer time than yesterday. (=or, 어제보다 오래 공부했어요. – It’s possible to omit 더 when it’s clear which one is more.)

*더 많이 literally means “more a lot” and it means “more in amount/degree.” 

**더 오래 means “more long time” so it means “longer time.”

 

Let’s look at some more example sentences:

튤립이 해바라기보다 더 아름다워요. – Tulips are more beautiful than sunflowers.

한식을 미국 요리보다 더 (많이) 좋아해요. – I like Korean food more than American food.

부산보다 서울에 더 오래 있었어요. I stayed in Seoul longer than Busan.

제가 지수보다 더 많이 먹었어요. I ate more than Jisoo.

 

You can also use “더(more)” without the comparative particle “보다,” when you’re not necessarily making specific comparison.

For example:

이 영화가 더 재미있어요. – This movie is more interesting. (You are comparing one movie to another, not specifying anything).

이 영화는 어제 우리가 본 영화보다 더 재미있요. – This movie is more interesting than the one we watched yesterday (here, you compare one specific movie to another using 보다).

 

저는 한국어를 더 열심히 공부할 거예요. – I will study Korean harder. (You are implying that you’ll study it harder than before or other people.).

저는 다른 학생들보다  한국어를 더 열심히 공부해요. – I study Korean harder than other students (you compare yourself to other students using ~보다).

 

더 자주 웃을게요. – I will smile more often (implies, from now on.)

울기보다는 더 자주 웃어. Smile more often than you cry. (you are comparing smiling and crying.)

 

    Adverb 덜 (less)

When you want to say that something is “less Verb/Adjective”, you can use 덜, which basically has the opposite meaning of 더 and is used exactly the same way.

1) 덜 + Adjective

간단하다 (to be simple) > 덜 간단해요 > less simple

편리해요 (to be convenient) > 덜 편리해요 > less convenient

힘들다 (to be difficult, energy-consuming) > 덜 힘들어요 > less difficult

따뜻하다 (to be warm) > 덜 따뜻해요 > less warm

춥다(to be cold) > 덜 추워요 > less cold

예쁘다(to be pretty) > 덜 예쁘다 > less pretty

 

2) 덜 + (Adverb) + Verb

좋아하다(to like) > 덜 (많이) 좋아해요

만나다(to meet) > 덜 (자주) 만나다

저는 요가가 달리기 운동보다 덜 힘들어요. – For me, yoga is less difficult than running. (=달리기 운동이 요가보다 더 힘들어요 / Running is more difficult than yoga.))

      text:
          """In this lesson, we’re going to learn how to use question words 무슨, 어느 and 어떤, and the differences between them.

 

First, let’s review how we use the question word “뭐” in a sentence.

뭐 읽고 있어요? / 뭐 읽어요? – What are you reading?

뭐 좋아해요? – What do you like?

뭐 보고 있어요? / 뭐 봐요? – What are you watching?

뭐 is a question word that can be used on its own to mean “what” and is considered a noun.

 

If you want to ask more specifically, you can use 무슨, 어느, and 어떤.

    무슨: what (adjective)

무슨 also means “what,” but unlike 뭐, 무슨 is considered an adjective, which means there should be a following noun that is modified by “무슨.”

무슨 + Noun = What noun

For example:

무슨 책 읽고 있어? / 무슨 책 읽어요? – What book are you reading?

무슨 음식 좋아해? – What food do you like?

무슨 영화 보고 있어? / 무슨 영화 봐? – What movie are you watching?

무슨 노래 듣고 있어요? / 무슨 노래 들어요? – What song are you listening to?

무슨 색이에요? / 무슨 색이야? – What color is it?

오늘 무슨 날이에요? – What day is it today? *asking about a specific day/occasion (like birthday[생일], anniversary[기념일] etc)

무슨 말이에요? / 무슨 소리예요? – What do you mean? / What are you saying? / What nonsense is it? 

무슨 생각해? – What are you thinking? 

 

A: 둘이 무슨 사이야? / 너희 무슨 사이야? – What kind of relationship do you have? (= Are you dating?)

B: a) 그냥 친구 사이예요. – We’re just friends.

b) 커플이에요. – We’re a couple.

c) 연인 사이예요. – We’re dating.

d) 남매예요. – We’re siblings.

 

우리는 친한 사이에요. – We are close.

우리는 사이가 좋아요. – We get along well.

사이 좋게 지내자. – Let’s get along well.

 

    어느

1) 어느 is used when there are a limited amount of options to choose from and a speaker asks “which one”. 어느 is also an adjective(modifier), so a noun has to follow. 

어느 거 멀을래? – Which one would you like to eat? 

어느 거 살래? – Which one would you like to buy? 

어느 책 읽을래? – Which book do you want to read? 

어느 노래 들을래? – What song would you like to listen to?

어느 나라 사람이 에요? – Which county are you from? (= Where are you from?). = 어느 나라에서 왔어요? 

 

2) 어느 can also be used to talk about unspecified or unidentified things.

어느 날 – One day (some unspecified day).

어느 여자가 울고 있어요. – Some woman is crying. (an unidentified woman I don’t know).

 

    어떤 different meanings

“어떤” is also an adjective (modifier.) It has three following meanings.

1) When a speaker wants to ask “What kind of ~?”, asking about traits or personality of a thing/person.

A: 어떤 책 좋아해요? – What kind of book do you like?

B: 소설책 좋아해요. – I like novels.

무슨 영화 좋아해요? – What movie do you like? (asking about the specific name of the movie)

어떤 영화 좋아해요? – What kind of movie do you like? (asking about traits of the movie)

무슨 맛이에요? – What flavor is it?

어느/어떤 사람이 좋아요?* – Which person do you like?

*어떤 can also have the meaning of “what kind of.”

  Lesson(

      category: "B2",
      text:
          """In today’s lesson, we’re going to learn the usage of the words “얼마” and “얼마나”.

Both of them have the same meaning of “how much”, but the usage is different.

For example:

얼마예요? – How much is it?

저 얼마나 예뻐요? – How pretty am I?

나 얼마나 사랑해? – How much do you love me?

 

    얼마: asking about the price of something

From the context above, you might have noticed that we use “얼마” when you want to ask how much something is.

얼마 can be used with “이다” and “하다 “ to ask how much something costs.

얼마 + 이다/하다 = how much is ­sth

얼마예요?/얼마해요? – How much is it?

이거/저거 얼마예요? – How much is this/that?

 

사과 두 개 얼마예요? – How much are two apples?

이 옷 얼마예요? – How much are these clothes?

요즘 아이폰 얼마해요? – What is the price for iPhones these days?

 

    얼마나 + Adjective

얼마나 can be followed by adjectives and verbs. It also can be replaced by “얼만큼”.

얼마나 (얼만큼) + adjective

얼마나 (얼만큼) + verb

 

For example:

얼마나 예뻐요? – How pretty is it?

얼마나 비싸요? – How expensive is it?

얼마나 커요? – How big is it?

얼마나 작아요? – How small is it?

 

A: 저 얼만큼 예뻐요? – How pretty am I?
B: 아주 예뻐요. – Very pretty.
>꽃만큼 예뻐요.* – You’re as pretty as a flower.
>별로 안 예뻐요.** – You’re not that pretty.

*Noun만큼 + Adjective = As much Adjective as Noun

**별로 안 Adjective = Not that much Adjective

 

A: 제프는 키가 얼마나 커요? – How tall is Jeff?

B: 저만큼 커요. – He is tall as much as me.
>별로 안 커요. – He is not that tall.
> 170 (백칠십) cm (센치)예요. – He’s 170 cm.

 

A: 한국 여름은 얼마나 더워요? – How hot is Korean summer?

B: 엄청 더워요. – Very hot.
> 진짜 더워요. It is really hot.
> 별로 안 더워요. – It’s not that hot.
> 동남아시아만큼 더워요. – It’s as hot as in South-East Asia.

 

    얼마나 + (Adverb) + Verb

얼마나 can also be followed by a verb in the present, past, and future tense. 

숙제 얼마나 했어요? – How much homework have you finished?

영화 얼마나 봤어요? – How much of the movie have you finished?

Actually,  a more accurate way to put it would be that 얼마나 is followed by an adverb that modifies a verb, but the adverb is usually omitted. 

얼마나 + (adverb) + verb

e.g.
얼마나 (많이) 먹었어? – How much have you eaten? 

남자친구랑 얼마나 (오래) 만났어? – How long have you been dating your boyfriend?

공부를 얼마나 했어요? – depending on the context can mean both:

    How much have you studied?
    How long have you been studying?

But, if you want to be more specific, you can add the adverb “많이” to ask “how much” and the adverb “오래” to ask “how long”.

공부를 얼마나 많이 했어요? – How much have you studied? 

공부를 얼마나 오래 했어요? – How long have you been studying?

시험이 얼마나 (오래) 걸려요? – How long does the exam take?

 

A: 숙제를 얼마나 했어요? – How much homework did you do?

B: a) 다 했어요. – I finished it all.

b) 거의 다 했어요. – I almost finished it.

c) 많이 했어요. – I have finished a lot of it.

d) 얼마 안 했어요. – I haven’t finished much. = 별로 안 했어요. 

e) 하나도 안 했어요. – I haven’t don’t anything.

 

Let’s look at more examples:

커피 두 잔이 얼마예요? – How much are two cups of coffee?

이것들 얼마예요? Or
이거 전부(everything)/다 (all) 얼마예요? – How much are these?

 

A: 제프 씨는 한국어를 얼마나 잘해요? – How good is Jeff’s Korean?

얼마 + 이다/하다 = how much is ­sth

얼마나 (얼만큼) + adjective

얼마나 + (adverb) + verb

* you can add the adverb “많이” to ask “how much” and the adverb “오래” to ask “how long”.

  Lesson(
      title: "Lesson 12. Verb’s Modifier Form",
      category: "B2",
      text: """First, let’s rewind how to use adjectives to describe a noun.

First of all, we need to take adjective’s stem and then put either “ㄴ” or “은”, depending on the last syllable of the stem.

 

Adjective Stem + ㄴ/은

For example:

행복한 여자 – A happy woman (행복하다 (to be happy) > 행복하 + ㄴ)

작은 아기 – A small baby (작다 (to be small) > 작 + 은)

즐거운 일생 – A joyful life (즐겁다 (to be joyful) > 즐거 + 운)

*When an adjective ends in “ㅂ”, it gets deleted and then we add “운” to the stem.

긴 머리 – Long hair (길다 (to be long) > 길다 > 긴)

**when adjectives end in “ㄹ”, “ㄹ” changes to “ㄴ”.

 

    Modifying a Noun with a Verb in the Present Tense

Now, let’s learn how to modify nouns with verbs.

For example, when a verb modifies a noun you can say:

The woman I love > 내가 사랑하는 여자

The man reading a book > 책을 읽는 남자

People who plant trees > 나무를 심는 사람들

The reason I love you > 내가 너를 사랑하는 이유

As you can notice, there’s a common pattern in these examples. The modified noun always comes last.

So, to make a sentence with a noun modified by a verb, you can use this construction:

Sentence (with the subject, object, and adverb, etc.) ending in a Verb (Stem) + 는 + Noun

e.g.
매일 한국어를 공부하는 학생 – A student who studies Korean every day

내가 일하는 회사 – The company that I work at

일찍 일어나는 새 – A bird that wakes up early (or, An early bird)

채소를 좋아하지 않는 아이* – A child who doesn’t like vegetables

*in this example, the verb “좋아하다” combines with a negative ending “~지 않다” and then we make it in a modifier form using “는”.

 

It is also possible to apply the same rule to Present Progressive. Let’s look at the examples:

엄마를 기다리는 아이들 – The children who are waiting for mom (a regular present form is used)
= 엄마를 기다리고 있는 아이들 – The children who are waiting for mom (here, we combined “Verb Stem + ~고 있다 + 는”)

점심을 먹는 사람들 or 점심을 먹고 있는 사람들 – People eating lunch

자는 아이 or 자고 있는 아이 – A sleeping baby

 

You can also use this construction with Noun 이/가 있다 or 없다 verb. 

For example:

창문이 있는 방 – A room with a window

창문이 없는 방 – A room with no window

끝이 없는 게임 – An endless game

 

There are also irregular verbs that require a different conjugation.

When a verb stem ends in “ㄹ”, you need to delete “ㄹ” and add “는” right after.

A crying baby > 우는 아기 (울다 (to cry) > 우 +는) > or 울고 있는 아기

The person I know > 내가 아는 사람 (알다 (to know) > 아 + 는)

The person that knows me > 나를 (or 날) 아는 사람 (알다 (to know) > 아 + 는)

Foreigners who live in Korea > 한국에 사는 외국인 (살다 (to live) > 사 + 는)

A making method > 만드는 방법 (만들다 (to make) > 만드 + 는)

 

    Modifying a Noun with a Verb in the Past Tense

So far, you’ve learned how to modify a noun with a verb in the present tense. Now, let’s look at how to modify it in the past.

To do so, you have to put “ㄴ/은” after a verb stem.

Verb Stem + ㄴ/은 + Noun

And you’ll get:

그 영화를 보는 사람 – A person who watches that movie (present) > 그 영화를 본 사람 – A person who watched that movie (past)

공부를 열심히 하는 학생들 – The students who study hard (present) > 공부를 열심히 한 학생들 – The students who studied hard (past)

책을 읽는 사람 – A person who is reading a book (present) > 책을 읽은 사람 – A person who read a book (past)

오지 않는 사람들 – The people who don’t come (present) > 오지 않은 사람들 – The people who didn’t come (past)

많이 먹는 아이 – A child who eats a lot (present) > 많이 먹은 아이 – A child who ate a lot (past)

나한테 전화한 남자 (past) – The man who called me

어제 밤에 운 아기 (past) – The baby that cried last night

* ”ㄹ” is also irregular in the past tense. To conjugate a modifying verb, we need to delete “ㄹ” and add “ㄴ”.

내가 만든 목걸이 – The necklace I made

 

So now we know that to modify a noun with a past verb, we need to add “ㄴ/은” to its stem.

However, when a verb has “있다/없다” in it, it follows a different rule. Let’s look.

Such modified past forms as “없은/있은” don’t exist.

Instead, you have to use these:

있다 > 있던 or 있었던

없다 > 없던 or 없었던

For example:

차가 없던/없었던 남자 – A man who didn’t have a car.

The usage of “~던” and “았/었던” will be explained in Intermediate 1 lesson. 

 

    Modifying a Noun with a Verb in the Future Tense

You take a verb stem and put “ㄹ/을” after it.

Verb Stem + ㄹ/을 + Noun

Let’s look at examples:

할 일* – The things that I will do. (=things to do)

살 것*  – The things that I will buy. (=things to buy)

*to not confuse the usage of “일” and “것”, both of them mean “thing.” But “일” is used when you talk about non-tangible things like situations or work, whereas, “것” is used for the tangible.

일어날 시간 – The time that I’ll wake up (=time to get up)

갈 곳 – The place that I will go to (=places to go)

(제가) 읽을 책 – Books I will read (=books to read)

먹을 음식 – The food that I will eat today (=food to eat)

제프가 사지 않을 것들 – The things that Jeff won’t buy

 

[Quick Summary]
Present Tense: Verb (Stem) + 는 + Noun

*있다 and 없다 are used with “는”.
**ㄹ > you need to delete “ㄹ” and add “는”.

Past Tense: Verb Stem + ㄴ/은 + Noun

*”ㄹ” >  deleted and “ㄴ” is added.
**있다 > 있던 or 있었던

없다 > 없던 or 없었던

    text:
        """To convert a verb into a noun in a Korean sentence, following patterns can be applied:

    Base Verb Stem + 기.

Ex. 저는 노래 부르기를 잘하는데 춤 추기를 못해요 = I am good at singing but not at dancing.

    Base Verb Stem + 는 거.

Ex. 저는 노래 부르는 걸 잘하는데 춤 추는 걸 못해요 = I am good at singing but not at dancing.

 

*Abbreviated form

거 + 가 = 게
것 + 이 = 게
거 + 를 = 걸
것 + 을 = 걸
기 + 를 = 길

 

    Sub + Obj + Verb + 기 makes the whole portion before ‘기’ a noun.

Ex. 외국인이 한국어를 혼자 공부하기가 어려워요 = It is difficult for foreigners to study Korean alone.

Ex. 친구들이 없이 운동하기가 지루해요 = Working out without friends is boring.

 

    Sentence/Verb + –는 거 = ‘the thing that Sub+Verb’.

Ex. 사람들은 좋아하는 게 달라요 = People like different things.  (좋아하는 게 = The thing that                                                                                                             people like)

Ex. 우리는 먹는 걸 좋아해요 = We like eating.

 

 

*Placing -는 after a noun makes it a Noun Modifier!

Ex. 아는 사람 = A person I know/A person who knows.

Ex. 저는 가르치는 일하고 있어요 = I do a teaching job.

*

-기 and -는 거 can be interchangeably used when talking about something in general. However, they are not always interchangeable!

 

When –기 and –는 거 cannot be interchangeably used:

    When followed by an Emotion Verb:

When -기 is followed by an emotion verb in a sentence, it sounds like an unfinished action about to be done in the near future. On the other hand, -는 거 followed by an emotion verb simply sounds like doing the said action in general and thus sounds more natural in such cases.

Ex. 저는 사람들이 저한테 소리치는 걸 싫어해요 = I don’t like people yelling at me. (In general)

저는 사람들한테 소리치기를 싫어해요. I don’t like yelling at people. (I will not do that.)

 

    When using Fixed Expressions:

When using Fixed Expressions in Korean, using -기 only is acceptable.

Ex. 이 카페는 쉬기 좋아요 = This café is good to take a rest at.

Ex. 네 꿈이 이루어지기를 바라 = I hope your dreams come true.

 

    When using ‘what…’ as a noun holder:

Using –는 거 over -기 is acceptable.

Ex. 나는 네가 원하는 걸 몰라 = I don’t know what you want.

Ex. 지수 언니가 저한테 *줬던 게 이 책이였요 = What Jisoo gave me is this book.   *(Past form)

 

 

    When using ‘that’ as a subordinate conjunction:

Using –는 거 over -기 is acceptable.

Ex. 우리가 서로 돕는 게 중요해요 = It is important that we help each other.

Ex. 나는 지수가 제프를 좋아하는 거 몰랐어 = I didn’t know that Jisoo likes Jeff.

*

Some other uses of 는 거-

     A. For emphasis/softness.

Ex. 이거 어떻게 하는 거야? = How can I do this?

Ex. 지금 어디 가는 거예요? = Where are we going now?

    그리고 = And.

그리고 is a Noun connector as well as a Verb/Sentence connector.

 

a) When used as a Noun connector, it functions as ‘And’ used for listing Nouns.

Ex. 영어, 한국어 그리고 러시아어 = English, Korean and Russian.

Ex. 이건 커피예요. 그리고 저건 차예요 = This is coffee. And that is tea.

 

b) When used as a Verb/Sentence connector, it turns into a Conjunction* by getting attached to the verb in a previous sentence.

Ex. 아기들은 항상 울어요. 그리고 웃어요 = 아기들은 항상 울고 웃어요 : Babies cry and laugh all the time.

Ex. 저는 영화를 봐요. 그리고 오빠는 책을 읽어요. = 저는 영화를 보고 오빠는 책을 읽어요 : I watch a movie and my brother reads a book.

 

*Making 그리고 as a Conjunction:

    PRESENT TENSE: Verb/Adj Stem + 고.

Ex. 저는 매일 운동하고 커피를 마셔요 = Every day I work out and drink coffee.

Ex. 지수는 귀엽고 친절해요 = Jisoo is cute and kind.

Ex. 학생들은 음악을 듣고 있고 선생님들은 춤을 추고 있어요 = The students are listening to music and the teachers are dancing.

 

    PAST TENSE: Past stem + 고.

Ex. 2004년에 저는 초등학생이었고 게임을 좋아했어요 = In 2004, I was an elementary student and I liked games.

Ex. 저는 커피를 마셨고 제프는 콜라를 마셨어요 = I drank coffee and Jeff drank coke.

Ex. 우리는 노래를 불렀고 춤을 췄어요 = We sang and danced.

*Note: When stating things in Past tense, it is not necessary to attach Past tense stem with 고. Present tense format of attaching Base stem with 고 can also be used in its place, as long as the rest of the sentence is in Past tense.

Ex. 저는 커피를 마셨고 제프는 콜라를 마셨어요 = 저는 커피를 마시고 제프는 콜라를 마셨어요.

      (I drank coffee and Jeff drank coke.)

 

Ex. 우리는 노래를 불렀고 춤을 췄어요 = 우리는 노래를 부르고 춤을 췄어요.

       (We sang and danced.)

 

Ex. 어릴 적에 저는 키가 작고 약했어요 = When I was young, I was short and weak.

 

    FUTURE TENSE: Future stem + 고.

Ex. 저는 학교에 갈 거고 엄마는 집에 있을 거예요 = I will go to school and mom will stay home.

Ex. 우리는 공부할 거고 쟤들은 잘 거예요 = We will study and they will sleep.

Ex. 저는 이거를 살 거고 제프는 저거를 살 거예요 = I will buy this one and Jeff will buy that one.

 

*Note: Same with future Tense. It is not necessary to attach Future tense stem with 고, as long as the rest of the sentence is in future tense.

 

Ex. 저는 학교에 가고 엄마는 집에 있을 거예요. = I will go to school and mom will stay home.

우리는 공부하고 쟤들은 잘 거예요. = We will study and they will sleep.

저는 이거를 사고 제프는 저거를 살 거예요. = I will buy this one and Jeff will buy that one.

 

    -고 = Then.

그리고 also has the meaning of ‘Then’.

Ex. 저녁을 먹고 설거지를 했어요 = I ate dinner and then did the dishes.

Ex. 10시간 동안 공부를 하고 바로 잤어요 = I studied for 10 hours and then went to sleep right away.

Ex. 편지를 다 쓰고 우체국에 갔어요 = I wrote the letter and then went to the post office.

Ex. 지수를 만나고 집에 갔어요 = I met Jisoo and then went home.

 

    -고 = at the same time.

-고 also has the meaning of doing one thing while also doing something else at the same time.

Ex. 네 손을 잡고 갈게 = Holding your hand, I will go.

Ex. 놀라지 말고 내 말 들어 = Don’t be surprised and listen to me.

Ex. 가방을 들고 뛰었어요 = I ran while holding my bag.""",

  Lesson(
    title: "Lesson 16. More usages of “-(으)ㄴ/는데”",
    category: "B2",
    text:
        """Just like we learned in the previous lesson, (으)ㄴ데/는데 comes from 그런데, and it is placed between two clauses to mean ‘but’ or ‘however.’

In this lesson, we’re going to learn MORE USAGES of (으)ㄴ데/는데 other than ‘but’ or ‘however.’ There are many ways & situations you can use it. 

The same grammatical rules apply. Before we start today’s lesson, let’s briefly review the construction rules of -(으)ㄴ/는데.
Present Tense Conjugation	Rules	Example
Adjective/이다 + ㄴ데	If there is no final consonant or the adjective ends with ㄹ consonant	

배고프다 + ㄴ데 = 배고픈데

멀다 + ㄴ데 = 먼데

이다 + ㄴ데 = 인데
Adjective + 은데	If there is a final consonant	좋다 + 은데 = 좋은데
Verb+ 는데	It doesn’t matter if the preceding verb stem ends with a consonant or vowel.	

가다 + 는데 = 가는데

먹다 + 는데 = 먹는데

 
Past Tense Conjugation	Rules	Example
Both verbs and adjectives	When the vowel in a verb/adjective is ‘ㅏ’ or ‘ㅗ’, ‘았는데’ is used.	가다 + 았는데 = 갔는데
 	when there is vowel other than ‘ㅏ, ㅗ’ in a verb/adjective stem, ‘었는데’ is used.	먹다 + 었는데 = 먹었는데
 	When a verb/adjective ends in ‘하다’, use ‘했는데’	공부하다 + 했는데 = 공부했는데

 
Future Tense Conjugation	Rules	Example
Adjective/이다 + ㄹ/을 텐데*	

Adj (that ends in vowel) + ㄹ 텐데

Adj(that ends in consonant) + 을 텐데

이다 + ㄹ텐데
	

피곤하다 + ㄹ 텐데 = 피곤할텐데

작다 + 을 텐데 =작을 텐데

이다 + ㄹ 텐데 = 일 텐데
Verb+ ㄹ/을 건데	

Verb (that ends in vowel) + ㄹ 건데

Verb (that ends in consonant) + 을 건데

이다 + ㄹ텐데
	

먹다 + 을 건데 = 먹을 건데

보다 + ㄹ 건데 =볼 건데
Irregular Adj/verb	

ㄹ ending stem : nothing attached, just the stem

ㅂ ending stem : deleted ㅂ and put 울
	

멀다 + ㄹ 텐데 = 멀텐데

맵다 + 을 텐데 = 매울 텐데

*we’ll learn more about the difference between -ㄹ/을 건데 and -ㄹ/을 텐데 in the next coming courses, and no need to worry much for now! :))

 

Now that we reviewed the grammatical constructions, let’s move straight into additional usages of -(으)ㄴ/는데!

 

1. When expressing different opinions, or claiming something’s not true

You can simply end the sentence with (으)ㄴ데/는데 in that case. Here are some examples:

유진: 나 안 사랑하지? Yujin: You don’t love me, do you?
인성: 사랑하는데! InSung: But I love you! (Saying what the other person said is not true)

 

유진: 같이 영화 보러 갈까? Yujin: You want to watch movie together?
인성: 싫은데… InSung: But I don’t want to… (Different opinion)

 

선생님: 네 이름이 지수니? Is your name Jisoo?
학생: 아닌데요. No. [아니다 + ㄴ데 + 요]

 

엄마: 너 숙제 다 안 했지? You didn’t finish your homework, did you?
아들: 다 했는데요. I finished it. (Unlike what you said, yes I did finish.)

 

엄마: 지수는 아마 집에 있을 거야. Jisoo might be at home.
나: 지수 지금 헬스장에서 운동하는데요. Jisoo is working out at the gym. (What you said is not true.)

 

2. Showing that you’re quite surprised by the results, because it turned out better or worse than you initially expected.

엄마: 피아노 레슨은 어땠어? How was your piano lesson?
유진: 생각보다 재밌는데요. It was more fun than I thought.

지수: 소금을 많이 안 넣어서 맛이 없을 거예요. I didn’t put much salt, so it won’t taste good.
지호: 맛있는데! But it’s good!

 

친구는 이 노래가 별로라고 했는데, 지금 들어보니까 좋은데요! My friend said this song isn’t that good, but as I’m listening to it right now, it is good!

 

A: 한국어 공부 잘 되고 있어요? How’s your Korean study going?
B: 생각보다 어려운데요. It’s more difficult than I thought. 

 

3. Setting the background for storytelling

You can start a story and give some background / setting by using (으)ㄴ데/는데. For example:
Background Info	Story
I went to a coffee shop yesterday	and coincidentally met my friend there!
어제 커피숍에 갔는데 우연히 친구를 만났어요!

What you really want to tell is ‘I coincidentally met my friend there,’ and ‘I went to a coffee shop yesterday’ is just a setting/background of that story. 

So you can put (으)ㄴ데/는데 to a background sentence, and then continue your story. 

 

More examples : 

팔이 아픈데 언제 나을지 몰라요. My arm is sore, and I don’t know when it will get better.

어제 생일 파티를 했는데 너무 재미있었어요. I had a birthday party yesterday, and it was so fun.

 

4. Giving background /  reason / context for suggestion, request, favor etc

You can also use (으)ㄴ데/는데 to give a background or context for what you’re suggesting, requesting or asking. 
Background/Reason/Context	Suggestion
제가 맛집을 아는데	거기로 갈까요?
I know a famous restaurant, shall we go there?

 Let’s look at other examples on how to use (으)ㄴ데/는데 to form request or suggestions:

지금 저녁 먹으러 가는데 같이 갈래요? I am going to eat dinner, do you want to join?

오늘 좀 바쁜데 내일 만날까요? I am a little bit busy today, can we meet tomorrow?

지금 비가 많이 오는데 이따가 가세요. It is raining hard now, leave later.

요즘 한국어를 공부하는데 모르는 게 있으면 질문해도 돼요? I’m studying Korean these days, and can I ask you questions if I have something I don’t know?""",

        "Lesson 17. How to say “so, therefore” 그래서, V/A-아/어서 & “because~” V/A-기 때문이다, Noun 때문이다",
    category: "B2",
    text: """그래서 (sentence connector) : therefore
V/A + 그래서 = V/A-아/어서 (conjunction)

 

1. Verb/Adj + 아/어(Present stem) + 서

Ex. 아프다 (to be sick) = 아파서(요)

저는 아파서 병원에 가요 = I am going to the hospital because I am sick.

저는 어제 아파서 학교에 안 갔어요 = I didn’t go to school yesterday because I was sick.*

*This form can be used to refer to both, Present or Past tenses.

So, 아파서요 can mean either: 1) Because I am sick or 2) Because I was sick.

Hence, it would be INCORRECT to use past stem while attaching -서 to it, and only Present stem should be used, even if it means past tense.

Ex. 공부하다 (to study) = 공부해서

    왜 성적이 좋아요? = Why are your grades good?
    공부를 열심히 해서요 = Because I studied/study hard.

Ex. 먹다 (to eat) = 먹어서

너무 많이 먹어서 배가 아파요 = My stomach hurts because I ate a lot.

Ex. 몸이 안 좋다 (to not feel good) = 몸이 안 좋아서

몸이 안 좋아서 밖에 못 갔어요 = I couldn’t go out because I wasn’t feeling good.

 

Using –이다 verb (to be) with –서:

When using -이다 verb with -서, it follows a slightly different rule: Noun+이어서/여서.

If the Noun has a 받침, use Noun+이어서 and if it doesn’t have a 받침, use Noun+여서.

Ex. 오늘 내 생일이어서 = Because it is my birthday.

Ex. 저는 여자여서요 = Because I am a woman.

In the same way, Noun+이라서/라서 can also be used.

If the Noun has a 받침, use Noun+이라서 and if it doesn’t have a 받침, use Noun+라서.

Ex. 오늘 내 생일이라서 = Because it is my birthday.

Ex. 저는 여자라서요 = Because I am a woman.

It is possible to omit 서 in this form.

Ex. 내일이 시험이라(서) 공부해요 = I am studying because there is an exam tomorrow.

Ex. 주말이라 수업이 없어요 = Because it is the weekend, there is no class.

 

+) Additional Grammar Point (not covered in the video)

It is also possible to combine the FUTURE TENSE stem with 아/어서, in which case it would be :
“Verb-ㄹ/을 거라서” or “Verb-ㄹ/을 거여서”

e.g.

저는 내일 학교에 안 갈 거라서 (=갈 거여서) 늦게 자도 괜찮아요. = I’m not going to school tomorrow, so it’s okay to sleep late.

이따가 저녁을 많이 먹을 거라서 (=먹을 거여서) 점심을 조금 먹었어요. = I will be having a lot of dinner later, so I had small lunch.

 

2. V/A-기 때문이다

FOR PRESENT TENSE: V/A(Base stem) + 기 때문이야/때문이에요.

FOR PAST TENSE: V/A-았/었(Past Stem) +기 때문이야/때문이에요.

Ex. 아프다 (to be sick) = 아프기 때문이에요.

    왜 병원에 가요? = Why are you going to the hospital?
    아프기 때문이에요 = Because I am sick.
    아팠기 때문이에요 = Because I was sick.

Ex. 공부하다 (to study) = 공부해서

    너는 왜 성적이 좋아요? = Why are your grades good?
    공부를 열심히 하기 때문이야 = Because I study hard.
    왜냐하면* 공부를 열심히 했기 때문이야 = Because I studied hard.
    *You can also start the sentence that ends in -기 때문이야 with 왜냐하면. It is kind of like saying, “to tell you the reason why~.”
     

Using –기 때문이야 with Nouns:

    Noun+때문이야/때문이에요 = It is because of (Noun)

Ex. 너 때문이야! = It is because of you!

Ex. 엄마 때문이에요 = It’s because of mom.

    Noun+때문에 + Subject + Verb = It is because of (Noun) + resulting sentence.

Ex. 날씨 때문에 안 갔어 = I didn’t go because of the weather.

Ex. 친구 때문에 늦었어요 = I got late because of my friend.""",

    category: "B2",
    text:
        """그래서 and 그러니까 both are sentence connectors that mean ‘so…’. They can also be translated as ‘because’ in some cases.

Both 그래서 and 그러니까 can be changed into Conjunctions, i.e. both can be attached to a verb in a previous sentence. This is done as follows-

 

Using 그래서:

    Reason sentence + 그래서 + Result sentence.

Ex. 친구의 생일이에요. 그래서 선물을 사고 싶어요 = It’s my friends birthday so I want to buy him a present.

    *Present Verb Stem+서 (=Verb+아/어서)

Ex. 많이 일해서 피곤해요 = I worked a lot so I am tired.

*Note that –서  is always used along with Present verb stem only, whether the sentence conveys actions done in the Past or Present Tenses!

Using 그러니까:

    Reason sentence + 그러니까 + Result sentence.

Ex. 친구의 생일이에요. 그러니까 선물을 사고 싶어요 = It’s my friends birthday so I want to buy him a present.

    *Base Verb Stem+(으)니까

Ex. 많이 일하니까 피곤해요 = I worked a lot so I am tired.

 

DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN 서 AND 니까–

    General Reason.

When talking about a reason in general in a plain sentence, while explaining the cause and its result, it is more natural to use -아/어서 than –니까. However, it isn’t incorrect to interchange the two in a situation where the listener is already aware of what’s stated as a reason.

Ex. 네 여동생이 왜 안 왔어? = Why didn’t your sister come?

      자서 못 와 = She was sleeping so she couldn’t.  (Here the listener is unaware of the reason and so -아/어서 is used, and you cannot use -니까)

Ex. 남자친구가 일 때문에 늦었지? = Your boyfriend is late because of work, right?

       응. 일해서 늦어. = Yes. He is working so he is late.

Or   응. 일하니까 늦어 = Yes. He is working so he is late.  (Here the listener is unaware of the reason and so both 니까 and 서 can be interchangeably used)

    Reason for these Emotion Verbs → e.g. “고맙다, 감사하다, 죄송하다, 미안하다, 반갑다”.

When expressing these emotions towards the listener, using 서 over 니까 is more natural.

Ex. 만나서 반가워요! = Nice to meet you!  (Literally = I have met you so I’m delighted)

Ex. 일찍 와주셔서 감사합니다 = Thank you for coming early.  (Literally = Because you came early, I thank you)

    When the sentence is in Imperative mood i.e. Commands, Suggestions, Requests.

When the Resulting sentence is in Imperative mood, only 니까 can be used!

Ex. 밖에 비 오니까 우산을 가져가! = It is raining outside so take an umbrella!

Ex. 속상하니까 저한테 말 걸지 마세요 = I am upset so don’t speak to me.

    Emphasizing the Reason.

Here, 니까 is used more commonly over -아/어서.

Ex. 왜 울어? = Why are you crying?

      배 고프니까 울죠! = I am crying because I am hungry, duh!""",

        """1. How to say, “I have to verb/adj” : Verb/Adjective-아/어야 되다, Verb/Adjective-아/어야 하다

Construction :
Verb -아/어(present stem)야 되다,
Verb-아/어(present stem)야 하다

Both are interchangeable and mean “have to.”

For example:

먹다 (to eat)  > 먹어야 되다 / 먹어야 하다 (to have to eat)

공부하다 (to study) > 공부해야 되다 / 공부해야 하다 (to have to study)

가다 (to go) > 가야 되다 / 가야 하다 (to have to go)

자다 (to sleep) > 자야 되다 / 자야 하다 (to have to sleep)

운동하다 (to exercise) > 운동해야 되다 / 운동해야 하다 (to have to exercise)

가르치다 (to teach) > 가르쳐야 되다 / 가르쳐야 하다 (to have to teach)

쓰다 (to write / use) > 써야 되다 / 써야 하다 (to have to write, use)

듣다 (to listen) > 들어*야 되다 / 들어야 하다 (to have to listen)
*듣다 follows an irregular conjugation rule 

행복하다 (to be happy) > 행복해야 되다 / 행복해야 하다 (to have to be happy)

건강하다 (to be healthy) > 건강해야 되다 / 건강해야 하다 (to have to be healthy)

똑똑하다 (to be smart) > 똑똑해야 되다 / 똑똑해야 하다 (to have to be smart)

noun 이다 (to be noun) >  (noun that ends in consonant) + 이어야 되다/ 이어야 하다, (noun that ends in vowel) + 여야 되다/여야 하다

 

Let’s look at some sentence examples.

When using it in a sentence, 되다 and 하다 are conjugated in its corresponding tenses :
Present – Verb-아/어야 돼요 (=해요) : have to verb
Past – Verb-아/어야 됐어요 (=했어요) : had to verb
Future – Verb-아/어야 될 거예요 (=할 거예요) : will have to verb

숙제를 내일까지 다 해야 돼요 (=해야 해요). – I have to finish the homework by tomorrow.

사람들을 친절하게 대해야 돼요 (=대해야 해요). – You have to treat people kindly. (대하다: to treat)

제 방이 지저분해서 청소해야 돼요 (=청소해야 해요). – My room is messy, so I have to clean it up.

오늘 단짝 친구의 생일이에요. 그래서 좋은 선물을 골라야 돼요 (=골라야 해요). – Today is my best friend’s birthday, so I have to pick out a good present. (고르다: to choose)

오래 살고 싶어요? 그러면 건강해야 돼요. (=건강해야 해요) Do you want to live long? Then you have to be healthy.

한국인 남자친구를 사귀고 싶어요? 그러면 한국어를 잘 해야 될 거예요 (=해야 할 거예요). – Do you want to date a Korean boyfriend? Then you will have to speak Korean well.

어제는 너무 피곤해서 일찍 자야 됐어요. (=자야 했어요.)  – I was too tired yesterday, so I had to sleep early.

 

2. How to say, “I/You must~” :

1) 반드시 / 꼭 + verb/adj-아/어야 되다, 하다

If you want to express a stronger obligation, almost like “must” in English, you can put the adverb 반드시 (or 꼭 = definitely) before V/A-아/어야 하다, 되다 construction. 

반드시 와야 해요! You definitely have to come! (=You must come!)

내일은 월요일이에요. 그래서 반드시 일찍 자야 돼요. Tomorrow is Monday, so I definitely have to (=must) sleep early!

마스크를 꼭 착용하세요. Make sure to wear a mask! (You must wear a mask!) 

한국에서는 술을 마시려면* 반드시 성인이어야 해요. To drink alcoholic beverage in Korea, you must be a legal adult. *Verb-(으)려면 means “If you want to/intend to verb,~”

2) V/A-아어야만 되다, 하다

Another way to say you MUST do something is by putting 만 after Verb-아/어야. This is literally emphasizing that you just have to do it, which can be translated as “must” in English.

오늘은 열 시 전에 자야만 해요. I must sleep before 10 pm today.

담배를 끊어야만 해요. You must quit smoking. 

 

3. Negation of “have to” and “must”

1) don’t have to, must not

When negating Verb-아/어야 되다/하다, you CANNOT say Verb-아/어야 안 되다/하다.

Verb-아/어야 되다,하다 cannot be negated this way.

There are separate constructions you can use to say “don’t have to” and “should/must not” each,

which are “안 V/A-아/어도 되다, V/A-지 않아도 되다 (don’t have to V/A)” and “Verb/Adj-(으)면 안되다(you should not V/A.)” We will learn this construction when we get to Beginner 3 Course. 

 

2) Don’t I/you/he/she/they have to~?

Verb-아/어야 되다, 하다 can be negated by using -지 않다 construction. So you can say, Verb-아/어야 되지 않다 or V/A-아/어야 하지 않다.

However, this does NOT mean “don’t have to” or “should not” in English. Instead, Verb-아/어야 되지 않다, 하지 않다 is used more often when asking questions like, “Don’t you/I have to~?”

e.g.

지수 씨 오늘 학교에 9시 까지 가야 되지 않아요? Jisoo, don’t you have to go to school by 9am today?

영화를 보려면 표를 예매해야 되지 않아요? Don’t I have to buy the ticket in advance to watch a movie? [표: ticket, 예매하다: to buy sth in advance]""",

  Lesson(
    title: "Lesson 20. How to say “or” (noun(이)나, Verb-거나)",
    category: "B2",
    text: """1. Noun + (a)나  

To link two nouns together, you use the (이)나 particle.  

You can use this by adding it to the first noun in the “or phrase.”  

 

NOUN + (이)나 + noun 

(NOUN or noun) 

 

If the noun has 받침, 이나 is added, whereas if the noun doesn’t have 받침, only 나 is added. 

 

Examples:  

A train or a car – 기차나 차… 

Older brother or sister – 오빠나 언니… 

Dinner or dessert – 저녁이나 디저트… 

The moon or the stars – 달이나 별… 

 

When used in sentences, it can be attached to both subjects and objects to maintain this “or” translation.  

In this case, it is more natural to remove any other particles/grammar points from the first option before (이)나 is added. 

In this way, any particles only appear on the second noun, for example: 
INCORRECT 	 	CORRECT 
차로나 배로 (X)	By car or by boat 	차나 배로 (O)
귀걸이를이나 목걸이 (X)	The earrings or the necklace 	귀걸이나 목걸이를 (O)

 

Example Sentences  

Do you have a dog or a cat?  

강아지나 고양이를 키워요? 

 

I will meet either my friend or my boyfriend tomorrow.

내일은 친구나 남자 친구를 만날 거야 

 

Either my mum or dad will ask you.  

엄마나 아빠가 너한테 물어볼 거야  

 

I will buy my daughter either a necklace or a book. 

딸한테 선물로 목걸이나 책을 사줄 거예요.

2. Verb/Adjective + 거나 

 

When creating the “or” meaning with verbs or adjectives, you use the construction: 

STEM + 거나 

(Regardless of 받침 or no 받침) 

 

Again, -거나is only added to the first option in the “or phrase.” 

The tense of these phrases is normally determined by that of the final verb of the sentence, for example:  

 

Present –  

I want to either order a pizza or go to a restaurant, but I’m still deciding.

피자를 주문하거나 식당에 가고 싶은데 아직 결정하고 있어요. 

 

Past –  

저는 어렸을 때 친구들이랑 등산을 가거나 수영을 했어요.
When I was young, I went either hiking or swimming with friends.

 

NB: -거나 can also be added to the past stem of a verb/adjective if that action has already been completed. In this way, you can indicate that this action happened in the past, without the final verb of the sentence having to also be a past action.  

 

If you’ve lost it or broken it, dad will get upset. 

그거 잃어버렸거나 부러졌으면 아빠가 화내실 거야. 

 

If you were bored or wanted to chat, you could have contacted me. 

심심했거나 얘기하고 싶었으면 저에게 연락할 수 있었잖아요. 

 

Future –  

If I’m not too busy or too tired, I will call you later.  

제가 너무 바쁘거나 피곤하지 않으면 나중에 전화할게요.

 

NB: normally, future verb stems aren’t used with this construction and instead replaced with present tense verb stems, especially if the sentence ends in a future tense verb  

e.g.  I will (/might) rest or sleep at home – 저는 집에서 쉬거나 잘 거예요.  

 

Sometimes, -거나 is added to BOTH options, but in this case, the final verb become 하다. 

For example:  

I will either buy a cake or make one.  = 케이크를 사거나 만들거나 할 거예요. 
Our family watches TV or plays game whenever we get bored. = 저희 가족은 심심하면 TV를 보거나 게임을 하거나 해요.

 

More Examples :

I’ll either stay here or study in the library.  

여기 있거나 도서관에서 공부할 거예요. 

 

Even if this grammar is too hard or you are confused, don’t give up.  

이 문법이 너무 어렵거나 헷갈려도 포기하지 마세요.  

 

If I earn more money or the price gets cheaper, I will buy that product. 

내가 돈을 더 벌거나 가격이 싸지면 그 제품을 살 거예요.  

 

When I went on holiday with my family, I was always either eating or shopping.

가족들이랑 같이 여행을 갔을 때, 나는 항상 밥을 먹거나 쇼핑하고 있었어. 

 

I hope the bus isn’t too full or too slow. 

버스에 사람이 너무 많거나 너무 느리지 않았으면 좋겠어요.  

 

I want to have 3 girls or 2 boys.  

딸 세 명이나 두 아들을 낳고 싶습니다.  

 

3. Sentence + 아니면 

 

아니면 also means “or,” and it literally means “if not.”

To connect two sentences, you would simply add “아니면” between the two. For example, 

 

Are you going to send this by post? Or give it to her yourself? 

이거 우편으로 보낼 거예요? 아니면 직접 줄 거예요?

You can also use it with a noun, like: 

An aunt or an uncle  

이모나 삼촌 / 이모 아니면 삼촌  

As well as this, it can be used in combination with -거나 and -(이)나 

 

I want to either order a pizza or go to a restaurant, but I’m still deciding. 

피자 주문하거나 아니면 식당에 가고 싶은데 아직 결정하고 있어요.  

 

4. (이)나, -거나 vs 아니면 

When they are used in questions, they have slightly different meanings.

For example,

이거 우편으로 보내거나 직접 줄 거예요? vs. 이거 우편으로 보낼 거예요? 아니면 직접 줄 거예요? 

The former question is asking whether at least one of these two options will be your choice (it’s a yes or no question), and the second one is asking which specific one (only one) choice you’ll make.

In a type of question where you ask which one choice the other person prefers/will choose, using sentence + 아니면 would sound more natural. 

e.g.

Does the skirt suit me better or the pants?

치마가 더 잘 어울려요? 아니면 바지가 더 잘 어울려요? (O)

바지나 스커트가 잘 어울려요? (X) – This question is asking if at least one of these two options suit me.

Do you think I passed or not passed?

합격을 했을까요? 아니면 안 했을까요? (O)

합격을 하거나 안 했을까요? (X) – This question does not make sense at all.""",

    그래도:

그래도 is a Sentence connector that is used when you want to say that the fact/condition stated in the first sentence doesn’t affect what’s stated in the next sentence. It can translate as ‘but still’, ‘regard less…’, ‘even if…’.

 

Sentence 1 (Sub+Obj+Verb) + 그래도 + Sentence 2 (Sub+Obj+Verb)

Ex. 비가 와요. 그래도 기분이 좋아요 = It’s raining. But still I feel good.

Ex. 많이 먹어요. 그래도 배가 안 불러요 = Even if I eat a lot, I’m not full.

그래도 can be changed into a Conjunction, i.e. it can be attached to a verb in a previous sentence to connect two sentences. This is done as follows-

 

Verb+아/어(Present Conjugation)+도

Ex. 비가 와도 기분이 좋아요 = It’s raining but still I feel good.

Ex. 배가 안 불러도 그만 먹어 = Even if you’re not full, stop eating.

Ex. 우리는 인종이 달라도 서로 사랑해요 = Regard less of our race being different, we still love each other.

Ex. 이 노래는 많이 들어도 질리지 않아요 = Even if I listen to this song many times, I don’t get tired of it.

Ex. 바빠도 와줘서 고마워 = Thank you for coming even if you are busy.

Ex. 감기가 나아도 머리가 아파요 = I got better from the cold but still my head hurts.

Ex. 고양이는 안 씻어도 냄새가 안 나요 = A cat doesn’t smell even if it doesn’t wash up.

 

‘이다’ (to be) Verb has its own rule when attaching –도to it:

Noun+이어도/여도 or Noun+이라도/라도

Ex. 천재여도 이 문제를 못 풀 거예요 = Even if you’re a genius, you won’t be able to solve this problem.

Ex. 좋은 학생이라도 열심히 공부해야 돼요 = You are a good student but still you must study hard.

 

    그러면:

그러면 translates to ‘If… then’. Just like그래도, it is a Sentence connector and can also be changed into a Conjunction. It is used as:

Condition + 그러면 + Result

Ex. 운동해요. 그러면 더 건강해질 거예요 = You should exercise. Then you will become healthier. 

 

Supposition/Imagination + 그러면 + Result

Ex. 매일 한국어를 공부하세요. 그러면 실력이 늘 거예요 = Study Korean every day. Then your skill will improve.

When using 그러면 as a Conjunction:

 

Verb (Verb’s Stem) + (으)면

Ex. 비가 오면 안 갈 거예요 = If it rains then I won’t go.

Ex. 많이 먹으면 살이 쪄요 = If you eat a lot then you will gain weight.

Ex. 하얀색과 검정색을 섞으면 회색이 돼요 = If you mix black and white colours then it becomes grey.

Ex. 성격이 다르면 자주 싸워요 = If your personality is different, then you fight often.

Ex. 시끄러운 음악을 너무 많이 들으면* 귀에 안 좋아요 = If you listen to a lot of loud music, it’s not good for your ears.

    title:
        "Lesson 24. Adj-아/어하다 : Adjective in Third-person’s POV | Making Adjective into Verb #2",
    category: "B2",
    text: """dj-아/어하다 (making adjective into verb#2)

    Adj-아/어하다 is used to describe someone else’s feelings that are seen by you.
    Therefore, it is mostly used with third person pronouns like: He, She, They; or with second person pronoun: You as Subjects in the sentence.

For example: 1) 엄마가 슬퍼요 (Mom is sad) → 2) 엄마가 슬퍼해요 (Mom is sad)

It is more natural to use the second sentence (adj-아/어하다) from the above examples as it reports Mom’s feelings seen by you.

Ex. 제 친구가 축구 경기에서 이기고 나서 엄청 기뻐했어요 = My friend was very happy after winning at the soccer match.

However, it isn’t completely incorrect to use the first sentence (using adjective alone) either.

    Using Adjectives on their own:

    a)In general instances:

Adjective on its own, without the 아/어하다 form attached to it, is used only when you can clearly see through someone else’s feelings or are 100% sure of their emotions/feelings.

For instance, when writing a story, the author is aware of their character’s emotions and in such a case, using Adjective alone is common.

        b) When speaking in the future tense, it is okay to use both: Adjectives on their own and Adjective+아/어하다.

Ex. 그 소식을 듣고 엄마가 엄청 기뻐할 거예요/기쁠 거예요 = Mom will be very happy to hear that news.

       c) When asking questions of how the other person i.e., the listener feels:

Second Person

(Adjective alone is used)
	

Third Person

(Both can be used but Adj+아/어하다 is more natural)

Are you sad? = 슬퍼요?
	

Is Jisoo disappointed? = 지수가 섭섭해요?/섭섭해해요?

Are you happy? = 행복해요?
	

Is dad happy? = 아빠가 행복해요?/행복해해요?

 

 

    Using Adj+아/어하다:

    a)With Adjectives of feelings and emotions:

Ex. 감사하다/고맙다 (to be thankful) → 감사해하다/고마워하다

지민 씨한테 고마워하는 사람들이 많아요 = There are many people who are thankful for Mr. Jimin.

Ex. 미안하다 (to be sorry) → 미안해하다

저는 지수한테 화가 많이 났지만 지수가 진심으로 미안해해서 용서해줬어요 = I was very angry at Jisoo but as she was sincerely sorry, I forgave her.

Ex. verb-고 싶다 (to want to be ‘verb’) → verb-고 싶어하다

너 이 인형 갖고 싶어했잖아. 그래서 네 생일선물로 준비했어 = You wanted to have this doll so I prepared it as a birthday gift for you.

Ex. 덥다 (to be hot) → 더워하다

아이들이 더워해서 에이컨을 틀었어요 = The children seemed to be hot so I turned on the air condition.

Ex. 춥다 (to be cold) → 추워하다

고양이가 추워해서 이불을 덮어줬어요 = The cat was cold so I covered it with a blanket.

Ex. 배 고프다 (to be hungry) → 배 고파하다

밥이 언제 돼요? 아이들이 배 고파해요! = When will the food get ready? The children are hungry!

NOTE: Adj-아/어하다 is a transitive verb, which means it can have an object; hence what someone finds adjective is marked by object marking particle(을/를).

Ex. 어렵다 (to be difficult) → 어려워하다

많은 사람들이 이 문법을 어려워해요 = Many people find this grammar difficult.

Ex. 지루하다 (to be boring) → 지루해하다

제 친구들은 한국어 공부를 지루해하는데 저는 재미있어요 = My friends find studying Korean boring but I find it fun.

Ex. 자랑스럽다 (to be proud) → 자랑스러워하다

엄마는 제 동생을 자랑스러워하세요 = My mother is proud of my younger sibling.

      b) Using Adj-아/어하다 in First person.

It is possible to use ‘First person Subject + Adj-아/어하다’ when you are seeing yourself as an observer with some distance.

Ex. 저는 어렸을 때 의사가 되고 싶어했어요 = When I was younger, I wanted to become a doctor.

Ex. 저는 비가 올 때마다 우울해해요 = Every time it rains, I feel gloomy.

     c) Common Verbs often used with all First, Second and Third person Subjects 

A common example of usage of Adj-아/어하다 is found in the formation of verbs like 좋아하다, 싫어하다, 예뻐하다 etc.

    Noun 이/가 좋다 → Noun 을/를 좋아하다
    Noun 이/가 싫다 → Noun 을/를 싫어하다

‘좋다’ (to be good; to like) and ‘싫다’ (to hate) are Adjectives that are used most commonly in First person, while ‘좋아하다’ and ‘싫어하다’ are Verbs that can be used with all First, Second or Third person Subject.

Ex. 엄마는 요리를 좋아해요 = Mom likes cooking.

Ex. 저는 공부가 싫어요/공부를 싫어해요 = I hate studying.

    Noun 이/가 예쁘다 → Someone 을/를 예뻐하다

예쁘다 and 예뻐하다 can also be used as a feeling meaning ‘someone is precious’ to you.

Ex. 저는 제 아들이 제일 예뻐요 = 저는 제 아들을 제일 예뻐해요 = My son is the most precious to me.

Ex. 선생님은 지수를 제일 예뻐하세요 = The teacher adores Jisoo the most.

    Noun 이/가 밉다 → Someone을/를 미워하다

밉다 means 1) to be ugly and 2) to hate, and 미워하다 is its verb form. They can also be used as a feeling meaning ‘to hate someone.’
The difference between 밉다 and 싫다 would be that 밉다 still has some intimacy in it, whereas in 싫다, there is not one drop of affection. 

Ex. 선생님은 지수만 예뻐하시고 저는 미워하세요 = The teacher only adores Jisoo and hates me.""",

    title: "Lesson 25. “Before” (전에, -기 전에)",
    category: "B2",
    text:
        """In this lesson, we will learn about the word 전 and how to use it with nouns and verbs.

 

First of all, 전 (前) means «front» referring to a place, and it also means «before» referring to time. In this lesson, you will learn 전 when talking about time.

Since it indicates time, it is mostly followed by “에,” the time marking particle, like “noun 전에 (before noun.)”

Some other particles that mark the time like 부터(from), 까지(to) can also be used, like “noun 전부터 (since before noun)” and “noun 전까지(till before noun).” 

 

1. Noun + 전에 : before Noun

출근 전에 : before going to work > 저는 출근 전에 화장을 해요. I put on make up before going to work.

점심 전까지 : till before lunch > 점심 전까지 끝내주세요. Please finish it (till) before lunch.

오후 1시 전에 : before 1pm > 오후 1시 전에 택배를 받았어요. I received the package before 1pm.

주말 전부터: from before weekend > 주말 전부터 기대됐어요. I was looking forward to it even before the weekend.

식사 전에 : before eating > 식사 전에 꼭 손을 씻으세요. Make sure to wash your hands before eating.

 

2. Time Duration + 전에 : [time duration] ago

When you combine the duration of time with 전, it means “(time) ago”. 

[Time] + 전에 = [Time] ago

 

For example:

저는 오 분전에 선생님을 만났어요. – I met my teacher 5 minutes ago.

일 년 전에 한국에 갔어요. – I went to Korea a year ago.

이 영화를 친구랑 두 달 전에 이미 봤어요. – I already watched this movie two months ago with my friend.

한국어를 오 년 전에 공부하기 시작했어요. – I started studying Korean 5 years ago.

저는 헬스장에 삼 주 전에 갔어요. – I went to a gym 3 weeks ago.

 

Now let’s look at how 전 can be used with verbs.

 

3. Verb-기 전에

Before studying this grammar construction, let me remind you of the verb’s nominalization in Korean.

Nominalization is a grammatical action that allows you to change a verb into a noun. In English, you use “Verb-ing” construction to do so.

e.g.

먹다 (to eat) > 먹기 / 먹는 것 (eating)

말하다 (to speak) > 말하기 / 말하는 것 (speaking)

운동하다 (to exercise) > 운동하기 / 운동하는 것 (exercising)

*We learned this in one of the previous lessons “Changing Verb into Noun (nominalization, verb-기, verb-는 것)“

 

Now you’ll notice that a verb is nominalized by using Verb-기 in “Verb-기 전에” construction. So it literally means, “Before Verb-ing.”

 

Let’s look at some examples:

저는 학교에 가기 전에 맛있는 아침을 먹었어요. – Before going to school, I had a delicious breakfast.

친구에게 전화하기 전에 숙제를 했어요. – I did the homework before calling my friend.

저는 영화를 보기 전에 엄마를 도와드려야 돼요. – I should help my mom before watching a movie.

제가 집에 오기 전에 엄마는 저녁을 준비할 거예요. – My mom will prepare dinner before I come home.

밖에 나가기 전에 우산을 가져가! – Take an umbrella before you go outside.

한국에 가기 전에 한국어를 공부했어요. – I studied Korean before going there.

한국에 가기 전에 한국어를 공부할 거에요. – I will study Korean before going there.

자기 전에 영화를 볼래요? – Shall we watch a movie before going to bed?

요리하기 전에 손을 씻어야 돼요. – You should wash your hands before cooking.

영화 보기 전에 팝콘 사자! – Let’s buy popcorn before watching the movie!

 

As you can see, the sentence that follows after -기 전에 can be in present tense, past tense, future tense or some other constructions like Verb-아/어야 되다(have to), Verb-ㄹ/을래? (invitation), imperative sentence etc. There is no limitation as to which type of sentence cannot come afterwards.""",

    category: "B2",
    text: """The word 후 (後) means “behind” or “after.” 

뒤 is a pure Korean word that also means “behind/after” and is sometimes interchangeably used with 후. But not always. We will learn when they’re interchangeable.

 

In the previous lesson, we’ve learned that the word “전 (前) ” is used with nouns and verbs to mean “ago” or “before”.

Noun + 전에 : before noun

Time Duration + 전에: (time duration) ago

Verb + 기 전에: before V-ing

 

후 (後) can also be used similarly, but with a slightly different structure when combined with a verb.

 

1. Noun 후에 : after noun

식사 후 > 식사 후에 다시 전화할게요. I will call you again after eating.

수업 후 > 수업 후에 만나자. Let’s meet after class. 

방학 후 > 방학 후에 다시 학교에 가야 돼요. I have to go to school again after school vacation.

1시 후 > 1시 후에 공항에서 친구를 만나야 돼요. – I have to meet my friend at the airport after 1 p.m.

 

2. Time Duration 후에 (=뒤에) :[time duration] later / from now

1시간 후(=뒤) > 1시간 후에 올게요. I will come an hour after from now.

이틀 후(=뒤) > 이틀 뒤면* 주말이에요! The weekend is two days away!
*Literally, “If it’s two days later.”

1년 후(=뒤) > 1년 후에 한국에 갈 거예요. I will go to Korea in a year.

오 분 후(=뒤) > 엄마는 오 분 뒤에 도착할 거예요. – My mom will arrive in 5 minutes.

 

3. Verb-ㄴ/은 후에 (=뒤에)

You add ㄴ when a verb stem ends in a vowel, and 은 when a verb stem ends in a consonant. Then you can add “후에” or 뒤에.

Verb Stem + ㄴ/은 후에 (=뒤에) = after I/he/she/they/you verb

You can simply conjugate the verb in the main clause if you want to indicate which tense the sentence is used, just like -기 전에.

한국에 온 후에 저의 한국어를 더 잘 하기 시작했어요. – After coming to Korea, I started speaking Korean better.

날씨가 걷힌 후에 밖에 갈 거에요. – I will go outside after the weather clears up.

제프한테 인사한 뒤에 자리에 앉았어요. After saying hi to Jeff, I sat at my seat.

이 집에서 20 년 동안 산* 뒤에 이사할 거예요. – After living in this house for 20 years, I will move to a new house.
*irregular : 살다 + ㄴ/은 = 산 (O) / 살은 (X) 

 

4. Verb-고 나서

There’s another construction you can use to mean “after you verb” and that is Verb-고 나서. You can simply add 고 나서 to a stem of a verb. There’s no irregular rules.

You can also just say, “Verb-고” and remove 나서. It would still mean “after verb-ing.”

Verb Stem + 고 (나서) : After Verb ~ing

영화를 보고 나서 잤어요. – After watching a movie, I slept.

수업 끝나고 (나서) 밥을 같이 먹자! – Let’s eat together after class.

숙제를 하고 친구를 만날 거예요. – After doing the homework, I will meet my friend.

저는 방을 청소하고 나서 저녁을 요리해야 해요. – After cleaning up my room, I have to prepare dinner.

저녁을 먹고 나서 부모님께 남자친구를 소개해드릴 거예요. – After eating dinner, I will introduce my boyfriend to my parents.

 

5. What are the differences between “Verb-고 나서” and “Verb-ㄴ/은 후에”?

In some textbooks, it says that in -고 나서 structure, the subject in both clauses should be the same. However, this is not necessarily true. 

For example, the following sentence would grammatically make sense, even if the subject in each clause is different. 

네가 가고 나서 (나는) 생각을 많이 해봤어. After you left, I thought about it a lot.

수업이 끝나고 나서 (저는) 화장실에 갔어요. After the class ended, I went to the bathroom.

 

Some textbooks also say that Verb-고 나서 can be used only when the action is complete, and that if the action is still ongoing, Verb-고 나서 cannot be used. But this is true of “Verb-ㄴ/은 후에” as well. After all, that’s what “after” means, right?

The grammar point regarding this will be explained more when we get to “More Usages of [Verb-아/어서]” lesson in Beginner 3 Course, so do rest assured for now!

 

The more practical differences between Verb-ㄴ/은 후에 and Verb-고 나서 are very subtle. Verb-고 나서 more means a subsequent action, so you do something “right after” you finish the previous action. Verb-ㄴ/은 후에 more means anytime after. But these two are usually interchangeable, without indicating much difference. 

Another difference would be that Verb-고 나서 sounds more casual and commonly used in spoken form compared to -ㄴ/은 후에, which sounds comparatively more formal.

 

So, -ㄴ/은 후에 can be interchangeably used in all the sentences we learned above using “-고 나서,” 

영화를 보고 나서 잤어요. (=영화를 본 후에 잤어요.) – After watching a movie, I slept.

수업 끝나고 (나서) 밥을 같이 먹자! (=수업 끝난 후에 밥을 같이 먹자!) – Let’s eat together after class.

숙제를 하고 친구를 만날 거예요. (=숙제를 한 후에 친구를 만날 거예요.) – After doing the homework, I will meet my friend.

저는 방을 청소하고 나서 저녁을 요리해야 해요. (=저는 방을 청소한 후에 저녁을 요리해야 해요.) – After cleaning up my room, I have to prepare dinner.

저녁을 먹고 나서 부모님께 남자친구를 소개해드릴 거예요. (=저녁을 먹은 후에 부모님께 남자친구를 소개할 거예요.) – After eating dinner, I will introduce my boyfriend to my parents.

네가 가고 나서 (나는) 생각을 많이 해봤어. (=네가 간 후에 나는 생각을 많이 해봤어.) After you left, I thought about it a lot.

  Lesson(
    title: "Lesson 26-1. When Verb-아/어서 means “After”",
    category: "B2",
    text:
        """We learned that Verb-아/어서 is a contraction of Verb + 그래서, a sentence connector that means “so, therefore.” (Check Beginner2-Lesson 17)

Verb-아/어서 has another meaning, which roughly means “after verb-ing”

So how is it different from Verb-ㄴ/은 후에 and Verb-고 나서, which also mean “after?”

Unlike Verb-ㄴ/은 후에 and Verb-고 나서 which merely state the sequential order of the actions that are not necessarily related to one another, Verb-아/어서 implies that the two actions are so closely related that the second action can only occur after the first action is done. Another implication is that you did the first action in order to do the second action.

Therefore, the closest translation in English would be either “after,” “and,” or in some cases “(in order) to.”

You can check the following examples below to get the better hang of its usage.

e.g.

한국에 가서 영희를 만났어요. = I went to Korea and met Younghee.

지금 식당에 와서 밥을 먹고 있어요. = I came to the restaurant and I’m eating here.

친구를 만나서 영화를 봤어요. = I met a friend and watched a movie.

목걸이를 사서 여자친구에게 줬어요. = I bought a necklace and gave it to my girlfriend.

의자에 앉아서 책을 읽었어요. = I sat on the chair and read a book.

딸기를 씻어서 먹어야 해요. = You should wash the strawberries to eat.

밖은 너무 추우니까 커피숍에 들어가서 얘기할까요? = Since it’s too cold outside, shall we go inside the coffee shop and talk?

나중에 커서 의사가 되고 싶어요. = I want to become a doctor after I grow up.

————————

However, when it’s used with verbs like 입다, 쓰다, 끼다, 신다 or 두르다 that designate the wearing of clothes and accessories, -아/어서 cannot be used. Instead, -고 is used in place of it.

입다: to wear (clothing, garment)
쓰다: to wear (glasses, mask, hat, cap)
끼다: to wear (hand / teeth accessories such as ring, mitten, bracelet, braces)
신다: to wear (shoes, footwear)
두르다: to wear (neck accessories, such as scarf, muffler, ties)

e.g.

  Lesson(
    title: "Lesson 27. “As soon as” (Verb-자마자) ",
    category: "B2",
    text: """
Verb-자마자 means “as soon as (S) + Verb.”

자마자 is added to a verb stem in the first clause, and it would mean, “as soon as (S) + Verb.” There are no irregular rules, so you can add any verb’s stem directly to -자마자.

e.g. 네가 나가다 + 자마자 => 네가 가자마자 (as soon as you left,)  + Second Clause

엄마가 일어나다 + 자마자 => 엄마가 일어나자마자 (as soon as mom got up,) + Second Clause

The verb in the following (second) clause decides the tense (present, past, future) of the whole sentence, and you cannot conjugate the verb attached to -자마자.

 

Let’s look at some example sentences.

 

    Verb-자마자 in Present-Tense sentence

오다 (to come) > 저는 집에 오자마자 신발을 벗어요. – I take off the shoes as soon as I come home.

일어나다 (to wake up) > 저는 일어나자마자 양치질을 해요. – I brush my teeth as soon as I get up.

보다(to see, to watch) > 내 문자 보자마자 답장해줘. Please reply as soon as you see my text message. 

끝나다(for sth to end, to finish) > 수업이 끝나자마자 나가자. Let’s leave as soon as the class ends.
– Here, the subject in the first clause (수업이 끝나다) and the second clause (나가자) are different. In the first clause, the subject is 수업(class),  and in the second clause, the subject is 우리(we – although it’s removed.) Whether the subject in each clause is different or the same, both are grammatically acceptable.

 

    Verb-자마자 in Past-Tense sentence

As we learned, if you want to use 자마자 in a past-tense sentence, you do not conjugate the verb that’s attached to -자마자. You conjugate the verb in the following clause. 

 

울리다(to ring) > 전화벨이 울리자마자 받았어요. – I answered the call as soon as my phone rang.

나오다(to come out) > 밖에 나오자마자 비가 왔어요. – As soon as I came outside, it started raining.

보다 (to see, to watch) > 저는 그 여자애를 보자마자 사랑에 빠졌어요. – As soon as I saw that girl, I fell in love with her.

다 하다(to finish sth) > 저는 숙제를 다 하자마자 친구의 집에 갔어요. – As soon as I finished the homework, I went to my friend’s house.

오다(to come) > 저는 일 끝나고 집에 오자마자 티비를 봤어요. – As soon as I came home from work, I watched TV.

사다(to buy) > 이 드레스를 사자마자 후회했어요. – As soon as I bought this dress, I regretted it.

시작하다(to start) > 누나가 다이어트를 시작하자마자 성격이 안 좋아졌어요. – As soon as my sister started going on a diet, her personality got worse.  

 

    Verb-자마자 in Future-Tense sentence

The same rule applies to the future tense. You conjugate the final verb.

 

도착하자마자 전화할게요! – I will call you as soon as I arrive.

수업이 끝나자마자 버스 정류장까지 뛰어갈 거예요. – As soon as the class ends, I’m going to run to the bus station.

너무 배고파서 집에 도착하자마자 밥을 먹을 거예요. – I am too hungry, so I will have some food as soon as I arrive home.""",

  Lesson(
    title: "Lesson 28. “When verb-ing” (때, -ㄹ/을 때)",
    category: "B2",
    text:
        """In today’s lesson, you will learn about the word 때, and how it can be used in a sentence.

때 means “(at that particular) time,” and can be used with nouns and verbs to indicate a period of time or the time when something happens.

때 is usually translated “when” or “during”.

 

Let’s look at how 때 is used with Nouns.

 

    Noun + 때

When you combine a Noun (that indicates a certain/particular time or period) with 때, it means “during that time.”

 

Let’s look at some examples:

내일 수업 때 발표해야 돼요. – I have to make a presentation during tomorrow’s class time.

방학 때 뭐 할 거야? – What are you going to do during the vacation?

점심 때 다시 얘기하자. – Let’s talk again during lunchtime.

수업 때 집중하세요. – Please pay attention during class.

시험 때 컨닝하면 안돼요. – You cannot cheat during an exam.

저는 중학생 때 공부를 안하고 놀았어요. 그리고 고등학교 때부터 공부를 시작했어요. – When I was a middle school student, I didn’t study but had fun. And I started studying when I was a high school student.

 

Note that you cannot use 때 with such words as 오전, 오후, 아침 and days of the week (월요일, 화요일, 주말 etc.)

 

Now, let’s look at how to combine 때 with verbs.

 

    Verb –ㄹ/을 때 + present, past & future verb

때 can also be used with verb, following the similar rules as verb-는 것. (verb that modifies a noun) 

When we use 때 with a verb, the future suffix “~ㄹ/을” is attached after a verb stem.

You add ㄹ to a verb stem ending in a vowel, and 을 to a verb stem ending in a consonant. Instead of 것, you use 때, because you’re talking about the time.

The verb in the following (second) clause decides whether the whole sentence is in present, past or future tense.

Verb Stem + ㄹ/을 때 + Second Clause : the time when Verb-ing + Second Clause

e.g.

먹다 (to eat) > 먹을 때 (when eating)
밥을 먹을 때 말을 많이 하지 마세요 > Don’t talk much when eating. (present)

자다 (to sleep) > 잘 때 (when sleeping)
저는 잘 때 꼭 창문을 닫아요 – I always make sure to close the window when I sleep. (present)

가다 (to go) > 갈 때 (when going)
내일 학교에 갈 때 버스를 탈 거예요 – I will take a bus tomorrow when going to school. (future)

말하다 (to speak) > 말할 때 (when speaking)
말할 때 제 눈을 보세요 – Please, look at my eyes when speaking. (present)

운동하다(to exercise) > 운동할 때 (when exercising)
아까 운동할 때(=운동하고 있을 때) 그 노래를 들었어요. I listened to that song when I was exercising earlier. (past)

읽다 (to read) > 읽을 때 (when reading)
책을 읽을 때 혼자 있는 걸 좋아해요. – I like being alone when reading books. (present)

없다 (to not have) > 없을 때 (when there is no)
시간이 없을 때 식사를 자주 걸러요. – I often skip meals when I don’t have time. (present)

있다 (to have / to be there) > 있을 때 (when there is)
우리 엄마는 집에 있을 때 맛있는 음식을 요리해요. – When my mom is at home, she cooks delicious food. (present)

시험을 보다 (to take a test) > 시험을 볼 때 (when taking the test)
아까 시험을 볼 때 너무 떨렸어요. I was so nervous when taking the test earlier. (past)

 

    Verb-았/었을 때 

We just learned that when we’re talking about what happened in the past, that the verb in verb-ㄹ/을 때 doesn’t have to be conjugated in past tense, and it can just be followed by a past verb in the following clause.

However, there’s also a past conjugated form of “-을 때” and the construction goes like this : Verb-았/었(past conjugated form)을 때  

 

So what is the difference between Verb-ㄹ/을 때 followed by a past verb and Verb-았/었을 때?

 

The former is used when you did the following action in the middle of doing verb.

Let’s look at the two example sentences in past tense, that we studied above : 

 

1) 아까 운동할 때 그 노래를 들었어요. I listened to that song when I was exercising earlier. (past)

You can see that the sentence means “when (I was in the middle of) exercising,” so using 운동할 때 instead of 운동했을 때 sounds much more natural.

You can also say, 아까 운동하고 있을 때 그 노래를 들었어요 using present progressive.

 

2) 아까 시험을 볼 때 너무 떨렸어요. I was so nervous when taking the test earlier. (past)

In this sentence as well, the sentence means “when (I was in the middle of) taking the test, so “볼 때” sounds more natural than “봤을 때.”

You can also say, 아까 시험을 보고 있을 때 너무 떨렸어요.

 

The latter is used when verb is something that you cannot be in the middle of doing. 

e.g.

제프를 처음 봤을 때 마음에 들었어요. – When I saw Jeff for the first time, I liked him.
→ When you see someone for the first time, you cannot be “seeing” that person. The moment of seeing someone for the first time is just one moment that passes in less than a second. So it would sound awkward to say, “제프를 처음 볼 때 마음에 들었어요 (X)”

한국어를 못했을 때 맨날 사전을 들고 다녔어요. – When I wasn’t good at Korean, I used to carry a dictionary with me every day.
→ This one’s actually interchangeable with “한국어를 못 할 때 + past verb.” (= 한국어를 못할 때 맨날 사전을 들고 다녔어요.)
You can be in the middle of not doing something well, because the state of not doing something well can last some time until you become good at it.

But “못했을 때” more clearly delivers that you used to be bad, and not anymore.

 

이 물건은 작년에 샀을 때 2000원 밖에 안 했는데 지금은 4000원이네요. – When I bought this thing last year, it was only 2000 won, but now it’s 4000 won!
→ This sentence doesn’t mean while in the middle of buying; it more means “upon purchase.” So 샀을 때 sounds better than 살 때.

If you want to use 살 때, you could say,
책을 살 때 공책을 공짜로 받았어요. – I received this notebook for free when I was buying books. (It implies that, While I was buying (paying for) books, they gave out a free notebook.)

 

[Quick Summary]:

Noun + 때 > when/during Noun

Verb-ㄹ/을 때 + present, past future verb: the time when (S) + Verb, Verb-ed, will Verb

Verb-ㄹ/을 때+past verb (in the middle of verb-ing) vs Verb-았/었을 때 (verb that you cannot be in the middle of doing)""",

    category: "B2",
    text:
        """There are 2 expressions that you can use to have the meaning, “while verb-ing (while doing something else simultaneously)”:

VERB + 는 동안
	VERB + (으) 면서
책을 읽는 동안 사과를 먹었어요  – While I was reading, I ate an apple.	

먹으면서 책을 읽었어요 – While I was eating, I read a book.

As shown, though they can both be used to indicate that two or more actions happened at the same time, they are NOT ALWAYS interchangeable.

1. VERB + 는 동안

 

When using this construction, 는 동안 is added directly to the verb stem regardless of 받침. The only case in which this is different is with irregular verbs with ㄹ 받침 (e.g. 놀다 – to play). In these cases, ㄹ 받침 would be removed from the verb stem before 는 동안 is added. (e.g. 노는 동안(O) / 놀는 동안 (X))

RULE: 1) The subject in the first and second clauses can be different OR the same.
2) The tense of the whole sentence is determined by the tense used in the following clause. 

Examples:

 

제가 노는 동안 동생은 열심히 공부했어요 – While I was playing, my younger sibling studied hard. (Subjects are different.)

저는 요리하는 동안 음악을 들어요 – I listen to music while cooking. (Subject is the same.)

내가 책을 읽는 동안 넌 뭐 할 거야? – While I’m reading, what are you going to do? (Subjects are different.)

내가 편의점 가는 동안 집을 청소해 – Clean the house while I go to the convenience store. (Subjects are different.)

 

2. VERB + (으)면서

 

When using this construction, (으)면서 is added to verb stems without 받침 while 으면서 is added to the verb stems with 받침. Again, irregular verbs with ㄹ 받침 (e.g. 놀다 – to play) are the only exception. In these cases, 면서 is added directly to the verb stem. (e.g. 놀면서 (O) / 놀으면서 (X))

RULE: 1) the subject in the first and second clauses MUST be the same. This subject is usually a person.
2) This construction can NOT be used for natural phenomena or occurrences that happen out of one’s control (e.g., weather, traffic etc.)
3) The tense of the whole sentence is determined by the tense used in the following clause. 

Examples:

 

울면서 웃고 있었어 – I was crying and laughing at the same time.  

운전하면서 말할 수 있어요? – Can you talk while driving?

기다리면서 저 잡지를 봐도 돼요 – You can read those magazines while you wait.

TV 보면서 과자를 많이 먹자 – Let’s eat lots of snacks while we watch TV.

기차 타면서 어떤 도시를 지나가나요? – Which cities are we going to pass by while we’re on the train?

음악을 들으면서 강아지를 산책시켰어요 – I walked my dog while listening to music.  

NB: Neither VERB + 는 동안 or VERB + (으)면서 can be used with adjectives.

(VERB + (으)면서 can have other meanings, some of which can be used with adjectives, but these will be taught in the intermediate course.)

Summary of Usage
 	VERB + 는 동안	VERB + (으)면서	Translation
The first and second clause subjects are the same	저는 요리하는 동안 음악을 들어요	저는 요리하면서 음악을 들어요	I listen to music while cooking.

        "Lesson 30. How to say, “Let’s Verb, Don’t Verb, and Let’s not Verb”",
    category: "B2",
    text: """1. Saying “Let’s” in 반말 : Verb-자.

Verb-자 ending is used when you suggest doing something together with the other person/people. It’s very much like “Let’s Verb” in English.

This sentence ending is only used when talking to someone in an informal / casual way. In other words, -자 ending is in and of itself 반말. You cannot any additional ending to make it 존댓말.

 

Verb Stem + 자: Let’s Verb

e.g.

밥을 같이 먹자! – Let’s eat together!

오늘 이 영화를 같이 보자! – Let’s watch this movie today!

빨리 가자! – Let’s go quickly!

밥을 먹고 싶어. 요리를 같이 하자! – I want to eat. Let’s cook together!

 

 

2. Saying “Let’s” in 존댓말

When you want to say “Let’s” in a politer or more formal way using 존댓말, there are two ways you can do this:

1) Using Imperative Sentence : Simply conjugate the verb in present tense.

 

Verb + 아/어 + 요: Let’s Verb

e.g.

한국어를 열심히 공부해요. – Let’s study Korean hard.

학교에 같이 가요! – Let’s go to school together.

우리 오늘 일찍 자요! – Let’s sleep early today.

맛있는 음식을 더 먹어요. – Let’s eat more delicious food.

 

2) Use ~ㅂ/읍시다 ending

-ㅂ/읍시다 is a suggestive form of -ㅂ/습니다 ending. You can think of it as the most formal way to say “Let’s.”

 

Verb Stem (that doesn’t end it 받침) + ㅂ시다

Verb Stem (that ends in 받침) + 읍시다

*irregular rule: If a verb ends in ㄹ 받침, then 1) ㄹ gets deleted and 2) ~ㅂ시다 is added to the verbs stem.
If a verb ends in ㅅ 받침, then 1) ㅅ gets deleted and 2) 읍시다 is added.

 

Let’s look at some examples:

가다 (to go) > 갑시다 – Let’s go!

먹다 (to eat) > 먹읍시다 – Let’s eat!

만들다 (to make) > 케이크를 만듭시다 [만들읍시다 (X)] – Let’s make a cake!

만나다 (to meet) > 오늘 만납시다 – Let’s meet today!

운동하다 (to exercise) > 운동합시다 – Let’s exercise!

집을 짓다 (to build a house) > 집을 지읍시다 [짓읍시다(X)] – Let’s build a house.

 

e.g.

내일 제프의 생일이니까 제프에게 선물을 삽시다. – It’s Jeff’s birthday tomorrow, so let’s buy him a present.

우리 계속 공부를 열심히 합시다! – Let’s continue studying hard!

조금만 더 기다리십시다. – Let’s wait a little bit more.

수업 끝나고 컴퓨터 게임합시다. – Let’s play computer games after school.

저는 이곳이 좋아요. 여기 또 옵시다. – I like this place. Let’s come here again.

 

Now, we’re going to learn how to negate imperative sentences, and tell the other person NOT to do something.

3. How to say “Don’t verb” 

If you want to command/tell somebody “not to do something”, you can use this negation verb : “verb-지 말다.” 

The literal meaning of “말다” is “to not do” or “to stop,” and it can be conjugated as follows:

Present] 말다 > 말다 + 아/어 > 말아 (=interchangeable with 마 / 마 is more commonly used in casual, spoken Korean)

Past] 말다 > 말다 + 았/었어 > 말았어

Future] 말다 > 말다 + -ㄹ/을 거야 > 말 거야 (말다 is a ㄹ ending verb, so it follows a irregular future tense conjugation rule)

 

When you say “Don’t,” it is an imperative sentence in present tense, we can go with the present conjugation 말아 or 마. 

Verb Stem + 지 말아(요) : Don’t Verb

Verb Stem + 지 마(요) : Don’t Verb

 

Let’s look at some examples:

하다 (to do) > 하지 말아(요) / 하지 마(요) – Don’t do it.

가다 (to go) > 가지 말아(요) / 가지 마(요) – Don’t go. 

오다 (to come) > 오지 말아(요) /  오지 마(요) – Don’t come.

말하다 (to speak) > 말하지 말아(요) / 말하지 마(요) – Don’t speak.

마시다 (to drink) > 마시지 말아(요) / 마시지 마(요) – Don’t drink. 

 

Let’s look at the levels of formality when using Verb-지 말다.

1) Verb-지 마 / Verb-지 말아  :  반말

Verb Stem + 지 마: Don’t Verb / used more often, especially in spoken form

Verb Stem + 지 말아: Don’t verb 

 

Example Sentences:

밥을 빨리 먹지 말아 / 먹지 마! – Don’t eat your food quickly!

걱정하지 말아 / 걱정하지 마! – Don’t worry!

아무한테도 말하지 말아 / 말하지 마! – Don’t tell anybody!

돈을 다 쓰지 말아 / 쓰지 마! – Don’t spend all your money.

내 시간을 낭비하지 말아 / 낭비하지 마! – Don’t waste my time!

 

2) ~지 마요 / 말아요 / 마세요  : 존댓말

If you want to make your sentence sound more polite/formal, you can add -요 ending to the grammatical pattern above and you will get:

Verb Stem + 지 마요 / 지 말아요: Don’t Verb

Verb Stem + 지 마세요 : Please, do not Verb (this sounds politer than the above 존댓말 forms, since you are using -시다 honorific verb.)
(Verb Stem + 지 말다 + (으)세요 = Verb-지 마세요.)

 

운동하다 (to exercise) > 운동하지 마요 / 운동하지 말아요 / 운동하지 마세요 – Don’t exercise.

가다 (to go)  > 가지 마요 / 가지 말아요 / 가지 마세요 – Don’t go.

하다 (to do) > 하지 마요 / 하지 말아요 / 하지 마세요 – Don’t do it.

보다 (to watch / see) > 보지 마요 / 보지 말아요 / 보지 마세요 – Don’t look/watch.

자다 (to sleep) > 자지 마요 / 자지 말아요 / 자지 마세요 – Don’t sleep.

 

 

4. How to say, “Let’s not Verb” 

As we’ve learned above, to say “Let’s Verb,” you can add -자 to a Verb Stem. We also learned that Verb-자 is an informal speech (반말.)

To say “Let’s not Verb” in 반말, you can combine Verb + 지 말다 + 자, and you’ll get : Verb-지 말자. 

Verb Stem + 자: Let’s Verb

Verb Stem + 지 말자: Let’s not Verb

 

오늘 저녁을 먹지 말자. – Let’s not eat this dinner today.

오늘 날씨가 추우니까 밖에 가지 말자. – It’s cold today, so let’s not go outside.

이 사람을 믿지 말자. – Let’s not trust this person. 

우리 말다툼 하지 말자. – Let’s not argue. (말다툼: argument)

 

To say “Let’s not verb” in 존댓말, you can use the two following grammar patterns:

Verb Stem + 지 마요/말아요 (combination of Verb Stem + 지 말다 + ~아/어요): Let’s not Verb

마세요 doesn’t apply here, because 마세요 is suggesting the other person not to do verb, not us. (시다 honorific form cannot be used with first person subject.)

 

You can also combine 말다 with -ㅂ/읍시다 ending.

Verb Stem + 지 맙시다 : Let’s not Verb

It’s 맙시다, not 말읍시다. (remember the irregular rule of ㄹ 받침) 

 

Let’s look at some examples:

이 영화는 재미없으니까 보지 마요 / 보지 말아요 / 보지 맙시다. – Let’s not watch this movie, it’s boring.

돈이 별로 없으니까 이건 사지 마요 / 사지 말아요 / 사지 맙시다. – We don’t have much money, so let’s not buy it.

 

[Quick Summary]

1. How to say “Let’s Verb”

1)반말:

Verb Stem + ~자: Let’s Verb

2)존댓말:

Verb Stem + 어/아 + 요

Verb Stem (Ends in Vowel) + ㅂ시다

Verb Stem (Ends in Consonant) + 읍시다
*except for irregular verbs

 

2) How to say “Don’t Verb”

Verb Stem + 지 말다

1)반말:

Verb Stem + 지 말아 

Verb Stem + 지 마 : more often used, especially in spoken form

2)존댓말:

Verb Stem + 지 마요 / 지 말아요

Verb Stem + 지 마세요 (Verb Stem + 지 말다 + (으)세요)

 

3. How to say “Let’s not Verb”

1)반말:

Verb Stem + 지 말자: Let’s not Verb

 

2)존댓말:

Verb Stem + 지 마요/말아요

        "Lesson 31. How to say “all, every, everything, everyone” (모든, 다, 모두, 전부, 여러분)​",
    category: "B2",
    text: """1. 모두 = everything / everyone / all

This can be used as both a noun and an adverb.

When used as a noun, it can be translated as “everything” or sometimes “everyone,” whilst when used as an adverb, its translation is closer to “all”.

Examples:

모두* 샀나요? – Did you buy everything?
*Note : when 모두 means “everything,” it’s slightly awkward to used topic/subject/object marking particles. So it’s better to write 모두 without them.

모두 깨끗해 보여요 – Everything looks clean.

모두 말해! – Tell me everything!

모두 무겁네요. – It’s all heavy.

모두가** 치즈를 잘 먹어요 – We all eat cheese well (/like cheese).
Since this 모두 means “we all’ as in “everyone,” it doesn’t sound awkward to put topic/subject/object marking particles.

 

2. 모든 = all + noun

When using 모두 to directly describe other nouns, it must be modified into its adjective form, 모든. This would then be translated as “ALL nouns” or “EVERY noun”.

Examples: 

모든 아이들은 학교에 다녀야 돼요 – All the kids need to go to (/attend) school.

모든 차들이 은행 뒤에 주차되어 있어요 – All the cars are parked behind the bank.

모든 모자가 나에 맞지 않아 – Every hat doesn’t fit me.

 

3. 다 = everything/all

Much like 모두, 다 can be used as both a noun and adverb to mean “everything” “everyone” and “all” respectively. In this way, 모두 and 다 are interchangeable; however, 다 often sounds more casual. It is also possible to combine the two words to form 모두 다.

Examples:

엄마 온다! 빨리 다 숨겨! – Mom’s coming! Quickly hide everything! (숨기다: to hide sth)

요즘에는 모두 다 연애를 하나 봐요 – I guess everyone is dating these days.

머리부터 발끝까지 모두 다 좋아해요 – From your head to your toes, I love everything (about you).

다들* 배고파해요. – Everyone is feeling hungry.
*When 다 means everyone, you can also put the plural marker “-들” and say “다들.” Same with 모두 when it means everyone; you can say “모두들.”

다 왔어요. 1) Everyone came. 2) Everything came. 3) I arrived / I’m almost there. (I finished coming)

 

NB: another difference between 모두 and 다 is that 다 can be used before verb to indicate that an action has been finished (e.g., 다 먹었어요 – I’ve finished eating, 숙제를 다 했어요 – I’ve finished my homework.). 모두 can NOT be used in this way.

Please check this vocabulary lesson for many ways to say “to finish.”

 

4. 전부 = everything, all of it

This word is formed of hanja, 전(全) “whole” and 부(部) “part” and so comes to mean the “whole part” or “all of something”. In this way, it is completely interchangeable with 모두 and 다 and can be combined with 다 in the same way as 모두 to form 전부 다.

SUMMARY: 모두 = 전부 = 다  and 모두 다 = 전부 다

The only difference is that 전부 is rarely used when describing people or other living things, and 모두 or 다 is often used in these cases.

Examples:

전부 다 가져가세요 – Take everything with you.

케이크를 전부 드릴까요? – Should I give you the whole cake?

 

NB: Note how 전부, 다 and 모두 can all be translated in the same way as 모든 + noun, when used to describe nouns (e.g., all nouns/every noun). The main difference, however, is that since 모든 is in its adjective form, it MUST be followed by a noun, whereas the other words would instead come after the noun.

e.g.
저희 부모님께 돈을 모두 다 드렸어요 – I gave all of my money to my parents.

그 사람의 말을 모두 믿을 수 없어요 – You can’t believe every word he says.

제가 읽은 책이 전부 재미있었어요 – Every book I’ve read has been enjoyable.   

모든 사람은 피자를 좋아해요 – Every person (/everyone) likes pizza.

 

5. 여러분 = everyone, all of you

When broken down, this word is made up of “여러,” meaning “many,” and “분,” the honorific form of 사람/ 명 which means “people”. Therefore, altogether, this translates to “everyone” or “you all / you guys”. As it contains this word 분, it can only be used to refer to people and is often only used when addressing a large group/crowd of people.

다들 can be used in the same way but is a lot less formal than 여러분.

Examples:

여러분, 모이세요! – Everyone gather around.

여러분, 어제 뭐했어요? – What did you guys do yesterday? 

여러분께 드리고 싶은 말이 있어요. – There’s something I wanna tell you guys.

여러분, 집중하세요! – Focus, everyone!

저녁 준비됐으니까 다들 먹으러 와! Dinner’s ready, so everyone come eat!

    category: "B2",
    text: """1. How to say, “Any Noun”, “Anything” and “Anyone”

1) “Any Noun”

Any song: 아무 노래

Any clothes: 아무 옷

(저는) 아무 노래 듣고 싶어요. (X) – this is a wrong sentence. “아무 노래” can be used by itself, but when it is used in a sentence, “나” or “이나” should be added right after.

So, you can say :

(저는) 아무 노래나 듣고 싶어요. – I want to listen to any song.

*when “나” or “이나” is used in a sentence, we don’t have to put any other particles like “을/를” or “이/가”.

아무 옷이나 입어도 돼요. (O) – You can wear any clothes.
아무 옷이나를 입어도 돼요. (X) 

 

2) “Anything” = 아무거나

아무(any) + 거(thing) + 나 

A: 어떤 거를 고르실래요? – Which one would you like to choose?

B: 아무거나 괜찮아요. – Anything is okay.

저는 아무거나 마실 수 있어요. –  I can drink anything.

Or, 저는 아무 음료나 마실 수 있어요. – I can drink any beverage.

아무거나 잘 먹어요. 저는 편식을 안 해요. – I can eat anything. I’m not picky.

 

3) “Anyone” = 아무나

When you want to say “anyone”, you have to put “아무” and then “나” right after it. Nothing is put between them.

*”아무나” can be replaced with “누구나” or “누구든(지).

아무나 (or 누구나, 누구든지) 한국어를 배울 수 있어요. – Anyone can learn Korean.

아무나 데려와도 돼요. – You can bring anyone.

 

2. How to say “Nothing” and “Nobody”

아무 + Noun + 도 + negative verb = no noun 

 

1)“Nothing” = 아무 + 것 + 도 (=아무것도) + negative verb

아무것도 means “nothing”, and it should ALWAYS be followed by a negative verb.

For example:

I don’t like anything. – 아무것도 안 좋아해요. (O)

아무것도 좋아해요. (X) – is a wrong sentence, as in Korean “nothing” should always be followed by a negative verb.

엄마가 저한테 아무것도 안 줬어요./주지 않았어요. – Mom didn’t give me anything. (= Mom gave me nothing).

저는 아무것도 안 살 거예요. – I will not buy anything. (= I will buy nothing).

 

To say “not any noun = no noun”, you can say “아무 + Noun + 도”.

저는 아무 걱정도 없어요. – I don’t have any worries. (= I have no worries).

아무 말도 하지 마세요. – Don’t say any words. (= Say no words).

 

2) “Nobody” = 아무도

아무도 has to be followed by a negative verb as well.

저는 아무도 몰라요. – I don’t know anyone. (= I know no one). [안 알아요 (X)]

저는 아무도 초대하지 않았어요. Or 저는 아무도 초대 안 했어요. – I didn’t invite anyone. (= I invited no one).

아무도 안 왔어요. – No one came.

아무도 없어요. – There’s no one.

 

3. 아무거나 / 아무나 + Negative Verb

Now we know that when we use 아무거나 or 아무나 with positive verbs, they mean “anything” and “anyone.”

But when they are combined with negative verbs, they have different meanings.

 

For example:

저는 아무 노래나 안 들어요. – I don’t listen to any songs. (I’m picky about what I listen.)

아무도 만나지 마세요. – Don’t meet anyone. (Meet nobody.)

아무나 만나지 마세요. – Don’t meet just anyone. ((Be picky about who you meet!)

저는 아무것도 먹지 않아요. – I don’t eat anything. (I eat nothing.)

저는 아무거나 먹지 않아요. – I don’t eat just anything (I am picky about what I eat).

아무거나 사지 마세요. 그리고 필요한 것만 사세요. – Don’t buy just anything. Buy only the things that you need.

 

[Quick Summary ]:

Any Noun > 아무 Noun + 이나/나

Anything > 아무거나

Anyone > 아무나

No Noun > 아무 + Noun + 도 + negative verb

Nothing > 아무것도 + Negative Verb

Nobody > 아무도 + Negative Verb

아무거나 / 아무나 + Negative Verb > is used to mean “not just anything, not just anybody.”""",

    category: "B3",
    text:
        """지 can act as a representation of time when used with the construction:

VERB STEM + ㄴ/은 지 + TIME이/가 + 되다

 

This is used to indicate the period of time that has passed between a past action and the present. To create this meaning, the tense of the action is indicated by the use of the past modifier ㄴ/은 and 지 is used to imply the start of the action. Therefore, this can literally be translated as “to become (time) since I started verb” or more naturally as “I have been doing verb for (time)…”.

 

Examples:

 

제프랑 사귄 지 6개월이 됐어요 – It’s been 6 months since I started dating Jeff (/I’ve been dating Jeff for 6 months).

밥을 먹은 지 5분이 됐어 – I’ve been eating for 5 minutes.

채식주의자가 된 지 3년이 됐어요 – It’s been 3 years since I became a vegetarian.

빅키샘의 유튜브를 구독한 지 8개월이 됐죠? – You’ve been subscribed to Miss Vicky’s YouTube for 8 months now, right?

Note: 지 and ㄴ/은 have to be spaced. This 지 should not be confused with the indirect question -ㄴ/는/은지 that we’ll learn in Beginner 3 course.

Unlike the examples above, it is also possible to use this construction for actions that are NOT still happening in the present. In this way, 지 is used to show the period of time since an action last occurred. In these cases, the most natural translation then becomes “It’s been (time) since I…”.

 

Examples:

 

밥을 먹은 지 5분이 됐어 – It’s been 5 minutes since I ate (/I haven’t eaten for 5 minutes).

샤워한 지 10분 됐어요 – It’s been 10 minutes since I last showered.

요리해 준 지 오래 됐잖아요 – (Come on, you know) it’s been a long time since you last cooked for me.

소설책을 본 지 한 3주일쯤 됐어요 – it’s been around 3 weeks since I last read a novel.

 

Note: As per usual, the 이/가 particle is removable.

 

To make this distinction more clear, 지 can be used with negatives.

 

밥을 안 먹은 지 5분이 됐어요 – I haven’t eaten for 5 minutes (/it’s been 5 minutes since I started not eating).

우리가 안 만난 지 사흘 됐어 – We haven’t met in 3 days (/it’s been 3 days since we started not meeting).

 

It is also possible to replace the verb 되다 in this expression with other verbs such as 넘다 (to go over, to be more than) and 지나다 (to pass by, for time to fly by) etc.

 

Examples:

 

한국어를 공부한 지 1년이 넘었어요 – I’ve been studying Korean for over a year.

선생님을 만난 지 벌써 3개월이 됐네요 – (I see that) it’s already been 3 months since I met my teacher.

이사온 지 벌써 이틀이 지났네요 – 2 days have already passed by since I moved in.

 

You can also form questions using 얼마나(how long) and 오래(for a long time) in this 지 construction:

 

한국어를 공부한 지 얼마나 됐어요? – How long have you been studying Korean?

운동한 지 오래 됐어요? – Have you been exercising for a long time?

미국을 떠나신 지 얼마나 됐습니까? – How long has it been since you left America? (very formal)""",

    text:
        """In today’s lesson, we will learn how to say “It takes this to do that.”

Let’s look at different ways to express it.

 

    Verb –는 데(에) [time] 이/가 걸리다

If you want to say that something takes a specific amount of time to do a certain action, you can use this pattern:

Verb -는데(에) [time] 이/가 걸리다

Here, 걸리다 means “to take.”

For example:

한국어 마스터하는 데(에) 10년이 걸렸어요 – It took me 10 years to master Korean.

라면 끓이는 데 10분이 걸렸어요. – It took me 10 minutes to make ramen. [라면을 끓이다 literally means to boil ramen.]

학교까지 걸어가는데 30분이 걸려요. – It takes me 30 minutes to walk to school.

남자친구가 요리를 잘하는 데 1년이 걸렸어요. – It took my boyfriend a year to cook well.

저는 많은 한국어 단어를 배우는 데 몇 시간이 걸렸어요. – It took me a few hours to learn many words in Korean.

걸리다 can also be conjugated in the past and future tense; “it took~” and “it will take”

e.g.
여기서 우리 집까지 가는 데 15분 걸릴 거예요. – It will take 15 minutes to get to my house from here.

숙제를 하는데 두 시간이 걸렸어요. – It took me two hours to finish my homework.

서울에 있는 모든 관광지를 방문하는데 일주일이 걸렸어요. – It took me a week to visit all tourist destinations in Seoul.

 

    Verb –는 데 (time, effort, money) 이/가 들다

Here, 들다 means “to take” and it can be used not just with time, but also effort or money.

Verb + 는데 (에) 시간이 / 돈이 / 노력이 들다: it takes time / money / effort to Verb

서점까지 가는 데에 시간이 많이 들어서 인터넷으로 주문하려고 해요. – It takes a lot of time to get to the bookstore, so I’m going to order it online.

컴퓨터를 수리하는 데 40만원이 들었어요. – It took 400,000 won to repair the computer.

외국어 실력을 늘리는 데에 많은 노력이 들어요. – It takes a lot of effort to improve one’s foreign language skills.

이 과제를 끝내는 데에  많은 시간이 들 거예요.(=시간이 걸릴 거예요.*) – It will take a lot of time to finish this assignment.

*These two are interchangeable when used with 시간, but the subtle difference would be that 들다 sounds more general whereas 걸리다 sounds like a more specific passing of time.

 

    Noun 은/는/이/가 (time, money, effort) 이/가 들다

If you want to say a certain noun takes time, you can use a simpler construction : Noun 이/가 (time, money, effort) 이/가 들다.

청소는 30분이 걸려요. – Cleaning takes 30 minutes.

요리는 매일 많은 시간이 들어요. – Cooking every day takes a lot of time.

장거리 연애는 노력이 많이 들어요. Long distance relationship takes a lot of effort.

 

Let’s look at more variations:

1) 넘게 + 걸리다/들다 : to take more than ~
(넘다: to go over, surpass)

우리 집에서 서울까지 가는 데에 한 시간 넘게 걸려요. – It takes over an hour to go to Seoul from our house.

외국으로 택배를 보내는 데에 만원이 넘게 들어요. – It takes more than 10,000 won to ship the package abroad.

시험을 준비하는데 1 년 넘게 걸렸어요. – It took me more than a year to prepare for the test.

 

2) 밖에 + 안 걸리다/들다: to take only ~ 

This construction contains Noun + 밖에, which means “only” and should always be followed by a negative verb.

Noun + 밖에 + Negative Verb : Only Noun / Nothing but Noun

웹사이트에 가입하는 데에 10초 밖에 안 걸려요. –  It takes only 10 seconds to sign up for the website.

모든 가구를 옮기는 데에 십 만원 밖에 안 들었어요. – It only took 100,000 won to move all the furniture.

친구네 집까지 5분 밖에 안 걸려요. – It only takes 5 minutes to get to my friend’s house.

 

3) [time, money] 도 안 걸리다/들다: to take less than ~

저 주유소에서는 세차가 5000원도 안 들어요. Car washing takes less than 5,000 won in that gas station.

택배를 보내는 데 10분도 안 걸려요. – It takes less than 10 minutes to send the package.

  Lesson(
    title: "Lesson 3. Auxiliary Verb #1| Verb-아/어주다’s usages",
    category: "B3",
    text:
        """In this lesson, we’re going to learn the meanings of “Verb+아/어 주다,” the 주다 auxiliary verb. 

Auxiliary verbs are a verb that is combined with & put after another verb, and usually the preceding verb is conjugated in present tense and then you put the auxiliary verb.

In case of 주다 auxiliary verb, it would be used like this : “Verb + 아/어 + 주다”

Let’s look at conjugations first:

하다 (to do) > 해주다 > to do sth for sb else

읽다 (to read) > 읽어주다 > to read sth for sb else

말하다 (to say, to speak) > 말해주다 > to say sth for sb else

돕다 (to help) > 도와주다 > to help somebody

*돕다 is an irregular verb, which is more commonly used with “주다” than by itself. 

**When a verb ends in “ㅂ”, it gets deleted and then we add “오”.

So, when you want to say that something is beneficial to you, or something that would be helpful for other people to do, you use this combination.

 

    Polite Request

When a speaker wants to make a polite request asking for something beneficial to them, that person would say:

도와주세요. – Please help me.

*if you say “도우세요”, it sounds like a command to another person to help you.

**when you ask for a polite request, ~(으)세요 ending is always used.

기다려주세요. – Please wait.

요리해주세요. – Please cook for me.

When we ask a person to do something for the other person’s benefits, we don’t use “주다”, for example:

좋은 하루 보내세요. – Have a good day.

감기 조심하세요. – Be careful of the cold.

공부 열심히 해! – Study hard!

 

    Expressing Gratitude

When a speaker wants to express gratitude for doing something beneficial for them, you can use Verb+아/어 주다. 

To say thank you for something, “그래서” is used:

(Subject) + (Object) + Present Verb + 서 + 감사합니다/고마워요.

Now, we need to combine it with “주다”:

(Subject) + (Object) + Present Verb + 주(시다) + 아/어 서 + 감사합니다/고마워요

일찍 와주셔서 감사해요. – Thank you for coming early. 

제 영상을 봐주셔서 감사합니다. – Thank you for watching my videos.

(저를) 가르쳐주셔서 감사합니다. – Thank you for teaching me.

우리한테 말해줘서 고마워. – Thank you for telling us.

 

    Verbs that are more commonly used with “주다” than by themselves

돕다 (to help) > 도와주다 

용서하다 (to forgive) > 용서해주다 (or, 봐주다)

돌보다 (to take care of/to look after) > 돌봐주다

안다 (to hug) > 안아주다 

아저씨가 저를 도와줬어요. – He helped me.

네가 나를 용서해주면, 뭐든 다 할게. – If you forgive me, I’ll do anything.

제프를 안아주고 싶어. – I want to hug Jeff. 

 

    When “주다” is replaced with “드리다”

When a speaker has to show respect to the receiver, the verb “주다” should to be replaced with its honorific form “드리다”.

e.g.

저는 하루 종일 할머니를 돌봐줬어요. (X) – It’s not completely wrong, but since grandmother is someone you definitely have to be showing respect to, it sounds politer to replace 주다 with 드리다.

    category: "B3",
    text:
        """In today’s lesson, we’re going to learn how to combine “보다” and “보이다” with a present verb and learn how to use it in a sentence. (Verb+아/어 보다, 보이다 / auxiliary verb)

“보다” means “to look, to see, to watch”, but when combined with another verb, it has a different meaning.

 

    The first meaning: to try doing something

The first usage of the “보다” combination with a present verb, is to tell someone to try or to attempt something in order to see the result of doing so.

First, let’s look at the conjugation rule:

Verb + 아/어/여 보다

하다 (to do) > 해보다 (to try doing)

먹다 (to eat) > 먹어보다 (to try eating)

가다 (to go) > 가보다 (to try going)

만지다 (to touch) > 만져보다 (to try touching)

살다 (to live) > 살아보다 (to try living)

이 게임 재미있으니까 너도 해봐. – This game is fun, so try playing it. 

이 빵* 내가 만들었어. 먹어 봐. – I made this bread. Try (eating) it.

*the object can be put first in a sentence in order to emphasize it.

제 강아지 귀엽죠? 만져보세요. – My puppy is cute, right? Try touching (petting) it.

머리가 많이 아프면 병원에 가봐. – If you have a headache, then try going to the hospital.

미국에 살아보고 싶어요. – I want to (would like) try living in the USA.

 

The combination of “Verb + 아/어 보고 싶다” has the meaning of “to want to try Verb-ing” or “would like to have a chance to Verb-ing”.

Also, the adverb “한 번” is frequently used with “아/어 보다” expression to add some softness to the verb one’s trying to do.

미국에 한 번 살아보고 싶어. – I would like to have a chance to try living in the USA.

 

    The second meaning: have/haven’t tried something

The second meaning is used to talk about one’s past experiences and ask about them. The accurate translation would be “have/haven’t done something”.

Also, you have to notice that “보다” has to be conjugated to the past form to indicate the experience in the past.

Verb + 아/어 봤다

미국에 가봤어요. – I have been to the US. > 미국에 가봤어요? – Have you been to the US?

저는 한국에 두번 가봤어요. – I have been to Korea twice. > 한국에 몇 번 가봤어요? – How many times have you been to Korea?

저는 미국에 살아봤어요. – I have lived in the US before.

지금까지/여태까지 실수를 많이 해봤어요. – I have made many mistakes so far.

그 책을 읽어봤어요. – I have read this book.

저는 말을 타봤어요. – I have ridden a horse.

저는 버블티를 마셔봤어요. – I have tried bubble tea before.

저는 쟤를 봤어요. (=저는 쟤를 본 적이 있어요*)– I have seen her.

*We don’t say 봐봤어요, it is wrong; we instead say “본 적이 있어요.” We’ll learn Verb-ㄴ/은 적이 있다 (talking about the past experience) grammar in the next lesson.

 

    The third meaning: Soft Command

When you want to make your comment less strong and demanding, you can use “Present Verb + 보다 + ~(으)세요” to soften your command, suggestion or encouragement.

For example:

기다리다 (to wait) > 기다려보다

A: 아직도 사장님이 안 오시네요. – The boss hasn’t come yet.

B: 조금만 더 기다려보세요. 곧 올 거예요. – Let’s wait just a bit more. He’ll come soon.

말하다 (to say, to speak) > 말해보다

A: 지금 통화 괜찮으세요? – Is it okay if I call you now?

B: 네, 말해보세요. – Yes, do call me (tell me what you want).

앉다 (to sit) > 앉아보다

e.g.
앉아보세요. – Have a seat, please.

키다 (to turn on) > 켜보다

끄다 (to turn off) > 꺼보다

e.g.

불 켜봐. – Turn on the light

불 꺼봐. – Turn off the light.

열다 (to open) > 열어보다

닫다 (to close) > 닫아보다

e.g.

문 열어봐. – Open the door, please.

문 닫아봐. – Close the door, please.

집에서 냄새가 나면 창문을 열어보세요. – If it smells at home, do open the window.

 

     4. The fourth meaning: Stay Verb-ing

Another expression is the Present Progressive combined with the “보다” verb to say somebody to keep doing something:

Verb Stem + 고 있다 + 아/어/여 보다

기다리고 있어봐. 곧 갈게. – Stay waiting, please. I will be there soon.

혼자 하고 있어봐요. 이따가 도와줄게. – Stay doing it alone. I will help you later.

먼저 먹고 있어봐. 음료수 가져 올게. – Eat it first, please. I will bring the beverage.

All the expressions above can be used without “보다”, but the verb “보다” makes the sentences softer, politer and more natural.

 

    Adjective + 아/어 보이다

The combination of the present adjective and “보이다” gives the expression “to look like Adjective”.

보이다 (to be seen, to be visible) 

First, let’s look at the conjugation rule:

Present Adjective + 보이다 (=Adjective + 아/어 보이다)

e.g.

많다 (to be many, a lot) > 많아 보여(요). – It looks like a lot.

적다 (to be small (in quantity)) > 적어 보여(요). – It looks like there aren’t many.

어렵다 (to be difficult) > 한국어는 어려워 보여(요). – Korean looks difficult.

쉽다 (to be easy) > 쉬워*보여(요). – It looks easy.

*When an adjective has “ㅂ” at the end, “ㅂ” has to be deleted and then “운” added.

행복하다 (to be happy) > 행복해 보여(요). – You look happy.

슬프다 (to look sad) > 슬퍼 보여(요). – You look sad.

깨끗하다 (to be clean) / 깔끔하다 (to be neat) >
화장실이 깨끗해 보여(요). – The bathroom looks clean.  / 글씨가 깔끔해 보여요. – The handwriting looks neat.

더럽다 (to be dirty) / 지저분하다 (to be messy) >
더러워 보여요. – It looks dirty. / 지저분해 보여요. – It looks messy.

건강하다 (to be healthy) > 건강해 보이세요. > You look healthy.

피곤하다 (to be tired) > 피곤해 보이세요. 좀 쉬세요. – You look tired. Take some rest.

 

[Quick Summary]:

To try doing sth: Verb + 아/어/여 보다

Want to try Verb-ing / would like to have a chance to Verb-ing: Verb + 아/어 보고 싶다

Have/haven’t done sth: Verb+ 아/어 + 봤다

Soft Command: Verb +아/어 + 보다 + ~(으)세요

To stay Verb-ing: Verb Stem + 고 있다 + 아/어/여 보다

To look like Adjective: Adjective +아/어 보이다""",

  Lesson(
    title: "Lesson 5. “I have P.P before” [Verb-아/어봤다, Verb-ㄴ/은 적이 있다]",
    category: "B3",
    text: """Have/haven’t P.P before  

 

There are 2 main ways to say that you “have/haven’t done…before”: 

 
Have done before 	Have NOT done before 
Present verb + 봤다 	안 + present verb + 봤다 
Verb stem + ㄴ/은 적이 있다 	Verb stem + ㄴ/은 적이 없다 

 *Present Verb : Verb + 아/어 봤다 

These are used to refer to someone’s past experience of doing something and can be used interchangeably.  

 

Present Verb + 봤다 

 

This construction is based on the addition of the verb 보다 to the present tense form of a verb and since you are talking about a previous experience, 보다 is commonly conjugated into the PAST tense.  

 

Examples: 

 

미국에 가봤어요? – Have you ever been to the US? 

한국에 살아봤어요 – I have lived in Korea before  

지금까지 실수를 많이 해봤어요 – I’ve made many mistakes so far  

그 빵을 먹어봤어요 – I have tried (eaten) that bread  

그 책 읽어봤어요 – I have read that book before 

그 노래 안 들어봤어요 – I haven’t heard that song before  

그 회사에서 일 안 해봤어요 – I have not worked at that company before  

제프랑 말해봤어요 – I have talked with Jeff before/I tried talking with Jeff* 

 

*Note: this construction can also express your attempt at doing something and so can mean “to have tried” (e.g., 제프랑 말해봤는데 말이 안 통해요 – I tried to talk with Jeff, but we don’t understand each other). Most of the time, you will understand which meaning the sentence takes with context. Be aware that this “to have tried” meaning is NOT interchangeable with ㄴ/은 적이 있다/없다.  

 

In the case of “to have seen before”, you would NOT have to add this extra 봤다. 

e.g., 쟤를 봤어요 – I’ve seen her (O) / 쟤를 봐봤어요 – I’ve seen her (X) 

If you wanted to add this extra nuance of past experience, it would be more natural to use the ㄴ/은 적이 있다/없다 construction. 

e.g., 쟤를 본 적이 있어요 – I’ve seen her before 

Verb stem + ㄴ/은 적이 있다/없다  

 

Again, this construction is used interchangeably with 봤다  to mean “have/haven’t before” 

In most cases, the VERB STEM + 보다 form is used as the stem, forming: 

VERB STEM + 본 적이 있다/없다 

 

The word 적 refers to a “past experience” and so when using 있다, you are literally saying “I have the past experience of…” and so it comes to mean you “have done” something. In the same way, when used with 없다, you are saying “I do NOT have the past experience of…” and so you are saying you “have NOT done” something. 

 

Examples: 

 

그 빵을 먹은 적이 있어요 – I have tried (eaten) that bread  

그 회사에서 일한 적이 있어요 – I have worked at that company before  

삼성 노트북을 써본 적이 있어요 – I have used a Samsung laptop before  

방탄소년단을 실제로 본 적이 있어요 – I have seen BTS in real life 

남자친구를 사귀어본 적이 없어요 – I haven’t had (dated) a boyfriend before  

제프는 제 앞에서 운 적이 없어요 – Jeff hasn’t cried in front of me before**  

 

**Note: ㄹ 받침 is removed before the construction is added forming 운 instead of 울은 

 

 그 노래를 들은 적이 없어요 – I haven’t heard that song before***  

 

***Note: 듣다 changes it’s stem to 들  when combined with은 

 

한 번도 can also be added to the “haven’t” version of this construction to emphasize that you haven’t done something “even once” before.  It can be added either before없다 or before the whole construction itself. 

e.g., 한국에 한 번도 간 적이 없어요 – I haven’t been to Korea before  

         한국에 간 적이 한 번도 없어요 – I haven’t been to Korea before  

 

Additionally, the 이 particle in 적이 있다/없다 can be removed  

e.g., 제프는 제 앞에서 울어본 적 없어요 – Jeff has not cried in front of me before 

 

Verbs already combined with 주다 

 

For the verbs already combined with 주다, an extra 보다 does NOT need to be added.

For example, 도와줘본 적이 있다/없다 and 도와줘봤어요 are NOT necessary.

Instead, ㄴ/은 적이 있다/없다 would be added directly to the 주다auxillary verb stem.  

 

Examples: 

 

제프는 저를 도와준 적이 있어요 – Jeff has helped me before  

아빠는 저를 안아준 적이 없어요 – My dad has never hugged me before 

여자친구는 (저에게) 노래를 불러준 한 번도 적이 없어요 – My girlfriend never sings for me  

우리 언니는 (저한테) 요리해준 적이 많이 있어요 – My sister has cooked for me many times****  

 

****Note: 많이 있다 can be replaced with 많다 and following the same principle, 많이 없다 can be replaced with 적다""",

        "Lesson 7. Verb-아/어야겠다 : I think one should, will have to, had better​ verb",
    category: "B3",
    text: """

There are many grammar phrases made of Verb-아/어야.

The most common ones would be : 

1) Verb-아/어야 되다

2) Verb-아/어야 하다

3) Verb-아/어야겠다

4) Verb-아/어야 (S) + (V) ~

We already learned first two phrases  :  “Verb-아/어야 되다” and “Verb-아/어야 하다. 

They both mean “to have to verb,” and can be used interchangeably. (Check Beginner2-Lesson 19)

e.g. 

내일 시험이 있어서 공부를 열심히 해야 돼요. I have an exam tomorrow, so I have to study hard.
=내일 시험이 있어서 공부를 열심히 해야 해요. 

이따가 엄마가 오셔서 집을 치워야 해요. Mom will be coming later today, so I have to clean the house.
=이따가 엄마가 오셔서 집을 치워야 돼요.

“야” in Verb-아/어야 indicates  “you should/need/have to” do something. 

With this in mind, let’s look at Verb-아/어야겠다. 

Now that know what Verb-아/어야 is, what is -겠다 that’s attached right after?

We learned that 겠다 is one of the future tenses in Korean (check Beginner2-Lesson8)

So Verb-아/어야겠다 literally translates to “will have to verb.” 

This can further translate to “had better” or “I guess one should~” in English.   

As you can see from its English translation, it’s a less stronger version of should/have to.

In other words, Verb-아/어야겠다 is used when something’s not necessarily required of one to do, but you think it would be best for someone (or oneself) to do that.

Now let’s compare the two sentences below.

통금이 있어서 밤 9시 전까지 기숙사로 돌아가야 해요. There’s a curfew, so I have to be back in the dorm by 9pm. 

vs.

너무 졸려서 밤 9시 전까지 기숙사로 돌아가야겠어요. I’m too sleepy, so I had better return to the dorm by 9pm. 

In the first sentence, Verb-아/어야 하다 indicates that it is required of you to return to the dorm because of the curfew. Almost like “must.” 

In the second sentence, you feel sleepy and although it’s not a must, you “think” it would be best for you to return to the dorm before it gets too late. 

Let’s look at another comparison.

사람은 잠을 자야 해요. vs 사람은 잠을 자야겠어요. 

If you are trying to say “Men must sleep,” which one do you think is a correct one?

Without a doubt, it’s the first one. 

Sleep is naturally required of humans to live on. Therefore, it would sound weird to say “사람은 잠을 자야겠어요 (I think men should sleep)” when it’s already a general/natural rule for humans to sleep. 

Let’s try one more.

This time, if you are trying to say, “Jisoo looks tired. She should get some sleep.” Which one do you think sounds natural?

    지수가 피곤해보여요. 잠을 자야 해요.
    지수가 피곤해보여요. 잠을 자야겠어요. 

Actually, both of the above would work, depending on how certain or assertive you want to sound on what Jisoo should do.

잠을 자야 해요 : Jisoo has to sleep.
잠을 자야겠어요 : Jisoo had better sleep, I guess she should get some sleep, She will have to get some sleep.

If you’re seriously worried for her, or you’re certain that getting sleep will make her better, you may use the first one.

If you’re worried for her but not up to a point where you want to assert what’s needed for her, you may use the second one.

Using Verb-아/어야 해요 doesn’t necessarily sound nosy or arrogant. It depends on what you consider the situation to be.

Can you feel the difference now? 

[Summary]

Verb-아/어야겠어요 is therefore used when you want to sound less assertive about what you think someone or yourself should do. Just like “had better” or “will have to” in English. 

Verb-아/어야 하다 : should (required), it’s a must-do, a general rule or even a command

[Quiz]

Which one sounds natural?

1. While watching sick people, I thought I should become a doctor.

숙제를 마감 기한까지 제출해야 해요. (O) – This one sounds natural.

1)Verb-아/어야 하다

2)Verb-아/어야 되다

both of which mean “to have to verb,”

and

3) Verb-아/어야겠다,

which is a less stronger version of the above two, and best translates to “had better,” “will have to” or “I guess one should.”

Today, we’re going to learn how to use Verb-아/어야 itself in the middle of a sentence, without putting extra verb or suffix right after it.

Verb-아/어야 + Sentence (next clause)

This would indicate that verb (attached to -아/어야) is a “precondition” of what’s stated in the following clause. In other words, the next clause cannot happen without doing the action in the previous clause.

For example,

연습을 많이 해야 한국어가 늘어요.

연습을 많이 하다, which is a verb attached to -아/어야, means “to practice a lot.” It is a precondition for the following clause “한국어가 늘어요 (Korean improves)” to happen.

So it can translate to “You have to practice a lot for your Korean to improve,” as in, without practicing hard, your Korean won’t improve. So it’s a required precondition.

Let’s look at another sentence.

일찍 자야 일찍 일어날 수 있어요. 

Here, you can find that 일찍 자다(to sleep early) is a precondition for the following clause “일찍 일어날 수 있어요 (You can wake up early.)

So it translates to “You have to sleep early to be able to get up early.” Sleeping early is a required action for getting up early.

  Lesson(
    title: "Lesson8 | Verb-아/어 있다, Verb-고 있다 : Continued State",
    category: "B3",
    text: """

It’s hard to find an equivalent grammar phrase of Verb-아/어 있다 in English. Therefore, rather than trying to translate it in English, it’s recommended to focus on when it’s used and what kind of verbs it’s commonly used with.

Verb-아/어 있다 is expresses a continuing state of a completed action. After a certain action is finished, inevitably a certain state continues, right? It’s used to describe that state.

Therefore, it is often used with passive verbs, such as 열리다 (to be opened), 닫히다 (to be closed), 켜지다 (to be turned on), 꺼지다 (to be turned off) and 놓이다 (to be put, to be placed) and also some of the intransitive verbs like 떨어지다 (to fall, to be dropped), 붙다 (to get attached) and 들다 (to be in sth).

We’ll learn more about the differences between active and passive verbs in Intermediate 1 course, including the ways to change active form of verb to its passive counterpart.

For now, let’s look at the example sentences using the aforementioned passive verbs and intransitive verbs.

e.g.

문이 열려 있어요. (열리다 : to be opened + 아/어 있다) The door is open. (As a result of the action of opening, it is staying open.)

창문이 닫혀 있어요. (닫히다 : to be closed + 아/어 있다) The window is closed. (As a result of the action of closing, it is staying closed.)

TV가 켜져 있어요. (켜지다 : to be turned on + 아/어 있다) The TV is on. (As a result of the action of turning on, it is staying on.)

배터리가 없어서 핸드폰이 꺼져 있어요. (꺼지다 : to be turned off + 아/어 있다) There’s no battery, so the phone is off. (As a result of the action of turning off, it is staying off.)

바닥에 누군가의 지갑이 떨어져 있어요. (떨어지다 : to fall + 아/어있다) Someone’s wallet is on the floor. (As a result of the action of falling, it is staying dropped.)

식탁에 숟가락이 놓여 있어요. (놓이다 : to be placed on + 아/어 있다) There’s a spoon on the table. (As a result of placing it on, it is stying placed on.)

지수 머리에 껌이 붙어 있어요. (붙다: to be attached + 아/어 있다) There’s a gum on Jisoo’s hair.

가방에 책이 한 권 들어 있어요. (들다: to be inside sth + 아/어 있다) There’s a book in the bag.

——————

Verb-아/어있다 can also be used with other action verbs like 가다(to go), 오다(to go), 앉다(to sit), 서다(to stand) and 눕다(to lie down), the result of which inevitably involves a continuing state.

e.g.

먼저 가 있어. 나도 곧 따라갈게. (가다 : to go + 아/어 있다) Go ahead. I’ll catch up soon. (As a result of going, you stay ahead or you stay there.)

저는 이모네 집에 와 있어요. (오다 : to come + 아/어 있다) I’m here at my aunt’s place. (As a result of coming, I am staying.)

친구를 기다리려고 벤치에 앉아 있어요. (앉다: to sit down + 아/어 있다) I’m sitting on a bench to wait for my friend. (As a result of sitting down, you are staying sat down.)

지하철에 빈자리가 없어서 서 있어요. (서다: to stand up + 아/어 있다) There’s no vacant seat in the subway, so I’m standing. (As a result of standing up, I’m staying stood.)

아프면 좀 누워 있어. (눕다 : to lie down + 아/어 있다) If you’re sick, lie down. (As a result of lying down, you stay lain.)

—————

However, for verbs meaning ‘to put on’ or ‘wear’ clothing or accessories, such as 입다, 신다 쓰다, 끼다 and 매다, you should be using –고 있다, not -아/어 있다.

e.g.

Mom’s wearing boots.

엄마가 부츠를 신어 있어요 (X)
엄마가 부츠를 신고 있어요 (O)

-> This would actually have double meanings.
1) Her boots are on her feet. (As a result of putting it on, the shoes are on.)
2) She is putting them on right now (in this case, -고 있다 would be used as present progressive.)

That man is wearing a hat, so I can’t see his face.

저 남자가 모자를 써 있어서 얼굴이 안 보여요. (X)
저 남자가 모자를 쓰고 있어서 얼굴이 안 보여요. (O)

The woman with a coat on is my sister.

코트를 입어 있는 여자가 우리 누나예요. (X)
코트를 입고 있는 여자가 우리 누나예요. (O)

My mom always has her wedding ring on.

엄마는 항상 결혼 반지를 껴 있어요. (X)
엄마는 항상 결혼 반지를 끼고 있어요. (O)

The man wearing a necktie is handsome.

  Lesson(
    title: "Lesson 9. How to say, “like a noun” (noun 같은, 같이, 처럼)",
    category: "B3",
    text:
        """The adjective 같다 (to be the same) can be used to express that a noun is like/the same as something else. The resemblance can be anything from looks, traits, personality etc. The constructions are slightly different and are as follows: 

 
TO BE LIKE(be similar to) NOUN 	TO BE THE SAME AS NOUN 
NOUN + 같다 (=똑같다)
(note that no particle is used)	NOUN 와 / 과 / (이)랑 / 하고 + 같다 

 

Examples: 

이건 커피 같아요 – It looks like coffee.  

캐나다 영어는 미국 영어와 같아요. – Canadian English is the same as American English.

저희 선생님은 엄마 같아요 – My teacher is like my mum.  

지수네 동생 이름이 제 이름이랑  똑같아요. Jisoo’s younger sibling and I have the same name. 

NB: In some cases, it is more natural to use the adjective 똑같다 which means “to be exactly the same” (e.g., my brother and I are exactly the same – 형이 저하고 똑같아요).  

 

Additionally, both 같다’s adjective and adverb forms can be used to create more complex sentences.  

 

Adjective  : 같은

 

The adjective form of 같다, 같은 can be used as follows: 

NOUN 같은 noun 

noun like NOUN 

 

Examples: 

 

저희 아빠 같은 사람 – a person like my father

강아지 같은 고양이 – a cat that resemble/acts like a dog

부모님 같은 선생님 – A teacher that acts like a parent

 

NB: There is actually a slang word for a cat that resemble/acts like a dog, 개냥이 (개 + 고양이).  

 

Example Sentences :

저는 부모님 같은 선생님이 되고 싶어요.
I want to become a teacher who’s like a parent.

저희 아빠 같은 사람이랑 결혼하고 싶어요. (Person (이)랑/와/과/하고 결혼하다: to marry a person)
I want to marry a person who’s like my dad.

 

Adverb : 같이

 

The adverb form of 같다, 같이, can be used to describe verbs, adjectives or adverbs as follows: 

 

NOUN 같이 Verb/Adjective/Adverb 

Verb/Adjective/Adverb like a NOUN 

 

Examples: 
 

저도 엄마같이 예뻤으면 좋겠어요 – I wish I was beautiful like my mum. 

나도 이제부터 너같이 열심히 공부할 거야 – From now on, I will also study hard like you.  

제 동생은 어른인데 아직도 아기같이 행동해요. My younger sibling is an adult, but still acts like a baby.

처럼 can also be used interchangeably with같이. 

 

Examples: 

지금은 겨울인데 봄처럼 따뜻해요 – It’s winter now, but it’s warm like spring.  

저도 엄마처럼 예뻤으면 좋겠어요 – I wish I was beautiful like my mum. 

나도 너처럼 한국에 오래 살고 싶어. I want to live in Korea for a long time like you.

 

The word 마치 can also be used at the start of the construction to make this nuance clearer. The word doesn’t have any meaning on its own but rather gives the listener a quicker indication that you are going to be comparing one thing to something else. (English equivalent would be “just like.”) An example includes lyrics from BTS’s song “Butterfly”.  

 

마치 나비처럼 – (just) like a butterfly. 

 

같이 can also be used to mean “together”. Another word for this is 함께; however, this sounds more formal and sometimes even poetic.

When using 같이 in this way, it is normally used with particles (이)랑, 와/과 or 하고 meaning “with”.  

 

Examples: 

저랑 같이 저녁 드실래요? – Do you wanna eat dinner with me?  

친구들이랑 같이 영화 보러 갈 거예요. I will go watch a movie with friends. 

 

NB: A similar expression to briefly take note of at this stage is “as much as…”. This can be achieved by using the construction: 

NOUN +  만큼 / Verb-는 만큼

As much as NOUN 

(e.g., 저만큼 – as much as me; 원하는 만큼 – as much as you want)

    text:
        """When expressing what something is about, the verb 대하다 can be used. This can either be constructed into its adjective form (대한) to describe a noun or into its adverb form (대해서) to describe a verb.

1. Adjective form : 대한

When used to describe other nouns, the adjective form of 대하다 can be used as follows:

NOUN에 대한 noun

noun about NOUN

This follows normal verb to adjective modification rules, adding either ㄴ/은 to the verb stem (here ㄴ because of the lack of 받침) to create its adjective form.

Examples:

 

한국어 공부에 대한 정보 –  Information about studying Korean

저희 가족에 대한 얘기 – Talk/story about my family

그 연예인에 대한 악성 루머 – A malicious rumour about that celebrity

사랑에 대한 노래가 너무 좋아! – I love songs about love!

우리 남편에 대한 비밀을 아무한테도 말하지 마세요 – Don’t tell anyone this secret about my husband

이 영화가 전쟁에 대한 영화인가요? – Is this film about the war?

2. Adverb form : 대해(서)

When used as adverbs to describe verbs, the construction formed is:

NOUN 에 대해(서) + VERB

Since 대해(서) is an adverb, it has to be followed by a verb.

The -서 is removable with no change to the meaning. However, since -서 is often omitted in written forms, 대해 is somewhat more formal than 대해서. Because of this, 대해서 is more commonly used in spoken language.

Examples:

 

지수 씨에 대해서 말해주세요 – Please tell me about yourself (Jisoo).

그 사건/이슈에 대해서 어떻게 생각하세요? – What (/how) do you think about that incident/issue?

평생 제일 행복했던 순간에 대해서 말해보자 – Let’s talk about our happiest moment in my life.

기후변화에 대해 들어본 적이 있어요? – Have you heard about climate change before?

    title:
        "Lesson 11. Giving/Asking Permission (Verb-아/어도 되다) & Prohibiting (~면 안되다)",
    category: "B3",
    text:
        """In today’s lesson, we’re going to learn how to express permission and prohibition in Korean.

The expressions you’re going to learn today:

    Verb + 아/어/여 + 도 돼요
    Verb + (으)면 돼요 
    Verb + (으)면 안돼요
    Verb+아/어/여 도 안돼요 

    Permission: Verb + 아/어/여 + 도 돼요

Before we start learning how to express permission in Korean, let’s break down the pattern first.

a) 도 comes from the sentence connector “그래도” which means “but still”.

Verb +아/어/여도 = even if Verb

Let’s take a look at the conjugations:

잘하다 (to be good at sth, to do sth well) > 잘하다 + 그래도 > 잘해도 

먹다 (to eat) > 먹다 + 그래도 > 먹어도

오다 (to come) > 오다 + 그래도 > 와도 

자다 (to sleep) > 자다 + 그래도 > 자도

e.g.

지수는 많이 먹어도 살이 안 쪄요. – Even if Jisoo eats a lot, she doesn’t gain weight.

비가 와도 괜찮아요. – It’s okay even if it rains.

저는 매일 일찍 자도 늦게 일어나요. – Even if I go to bed early, I wake up late. 

저는 한국어를 잘해요. 그래도 열심히 공부해요. – I am good at Korean, but still I study hard.
=저는 한국어를 잘해도 열심히 공부해요. – Even if I’m good at Korean, I study hard.

 

b) “돼요” meaning

돼요 comes after the verb “되다”.

Let’s look at how “되다” is conjugated in different tenses.

Present: 돼요

Past: 됐어요

Future: 될 거예요

Let’s look how “되다” can be used in a sentence.

 

“Noun 이/가 되다” has several different meanings.

Meaning #1: to become Noun

저는 선생님 되고 싶어요. – I want to become a teacher.

그 아이가 어른이 됐어요. – That child became an adult.

Meaning #2: for Noun to work

It’s different from the “일하다” verb.

휴대폰이 이제 돼요. – My phone works now.

제 컴퓨터가 안 돼요. – My computer doesn’t work.

노력해도 안 돼요. – Even if I try hard it doesn’t work.

Meaning #3: (for a situation or action) to be okay, fine

늦어도 돼. – It’s okay to be late. (Even if you’re late, it’s fine).

This meaning of “되다” is close to the meaning of the expression “Verb +아/어 + 도 되다”, which you’re going to learn later in the lesson.

(S) + (O) + Verb + 아/어/여 도 되다 can mean:

> to be okay even if (S) + (O) + Verb

> it’s okay to Verb (expressing permission)

늦어도 돼요. – It’s okay to be late.

공부를 많이 안 해도 돼요. – It’s okay not to study too much.

오늘 시간이 없으면 내일 와도 돼요. – If you don’t have time today, you can come tomorrow.

엄마, 오늘 좀 늦게 자도 돼요? – Mom, can I go to bed a little bit today?

Meaning #4: “that still works / that’s fine too” (conceding)

원래 수업 시간이 4 시인데, 오늘은 5시 에 해도 돼요. – The initial class time is 4 o’clock, but we can do it at 5 (it still works).

저는 주로 아메리카노를 마시는데, 라떼를 주문해도 돼요. – I usually drink Americano, but it will be okay to order Latte.

저는 강아지를 키우고 싶었는데, 대신 고양이를 키워도 돼요. – I wanted to raise a puppy, but it’s okay to raise a cat instead.

Now, let’s move to the second expression.

 

    Verb ~(으)면 돼요 / ~(으)면 안 돼요

To understand the ~(으)면 돼요 expression better, let’s break it down:

~(으)면 = 그러면 (if/then)

The conjunction ~(으)면 comes from the sentence connector “그러면” which means “if/when”.

Sentence Connector > (S) + (O) + V. 그러면 (S) + (O) + V.

Conjunction > (S) + (O) + Verb Stem + (으)면 + (S) + (O) + V = If the first sentence happens, then the second sentence happens.

열심히 공부해요. 그러면 시험을 잘 볼 거예요. > 열심히 공부하면 시험을 잘 볼 거예요. – If you study hard, you will do well on the test.

성적이 좋으면 좋은 대학교에 갈 수 있어요. – If your grades are good, you can go to a good university.

많이 막으면 살이 쪄요. – If you eat a lot, you gain weight.

So, the meaning of the “Verb + (으)면 돼요” expression means “it works if (S) + (O) + V”.

This expression is used when a speaker is explaining what works or what a listener is supposed to do in a specific situation.

For example:

A: 한국어를 잘하려면 어떻게 해야 돼요? – What should I do if I want to be good at Korean?

B: 매일 공부하면 돼요. – You can study every day. (That’s what works in this situation or this is what you’re supposed to do).

*notice that the translation of “can” in the sentence above is different from the expression “~ㄹ/을 수 있다” which expresses one’s ability to do something.

A: 컴퓨터 어떻게 꺼요? – How do I turn off the computer?

B: “종료” 버튼을 누르면 돼요. – You can just press the “shutdown” button.

내일 2시까지 오시면 돼요. – You can come by 2 tomorrow.

This expression can also be used when telling somebody what they supposed to do or politely asking them to do something.

A: 이거 누구한테 주면 돼요? – To whom should I give it?

B: 저한테 주시면 돼요. – You can give it to me. (politely telling a person what they are supposed to do).

Whereas, using “저한테 주셔도 돼요” expresses permission.

그 고객한테 내일까지 이메일을 보내시면 돼요. – You can send an email to that customer by tomorrow. (politely telling what to do)

 

    ~(으)면 안 돼요

Now, let’s look at the negated expression “~(으)면 안 돼요”.

This expression has several different meanings depending on how it is used in a sentence. 

 

a) When “~(으)면 안 돼요” is a statement = it doesn’t work if~ (prohibition)

When used like this in a sentence the speaker expresses prohibition and tell another person what they shouldn’t do.

e.g.

만지면 안 돼요. – You cannot / should not touch it.

늦게 오면 안 돼요. – You cannot / shouldn’t come late.

너무 많이 먹으면 안 돼요. – You cannot / shouldn’t eat too much.

*내일 비가 오면 안 돼요. – It shouldn’t rain tomorrow!

* It can also be used in situations that you can’t control but when you want to express that something should not happen.

 

b) When “~(으)면 안 돼요” is a question = asking for permission

지금 가면 안 돼요? – Can I go now?

숙제를 내일 하면 안 돼요? – Can I do the homework tomorrow?

오늘 피자 먹으면 안 돼요? – Can I/we eat pizza today?

A similar meaning of permission can be expressed with “~도 돼요?”.

The difference between “~(으)면 안 돼요?” and “~도 돼요?” is that when you use”~(으)면 안 돼요?” you’re expecting the other person to say yes and it sounds like a plead. It also sounds like a suggestion and usually used when the subject is “we”. 

Whereas “~도 돼요?” is used when the speaker is curious if something is permissible to the other person.

Let’s look at some examples:

올해 제주도로 여행 가면 안 돼요? – Can we go traveling to 제주 island? (here, the speaker is suggesting, almost pleading another person)

올해 제주도로 여행 가도 돼요? – Can we go traveling to 제주 island? (the speaker asking another person if it is permissible for them to do the action)

 

    Verb + 아/어/여 + 도 안 돼요 meanings    

a) it doesn’t work even if~

(아무리) 노력해도 안 돼요. – Even if I try, It doesn’t work.

* 아무리 + Verb / Adjective > no matter how much Verb / Adjective

이 컴퓨터는 (아무리) 고쳐도 안 돼요. – This computer won’t work even if I try to fix it. 

아무리 들어도 이해가 안 돼요. – No matter how much I listen, I don’t understand.

b) even verb isn’t allowed either

저희 동네에서는 밤에 떠들면 안 돼요. 애완동물을 키워도 안 돼요. – In our neighborhood, it’s not allowed to be loud at night. Having pets isn’t allowed either.

 

[Quick Summary]:

Verb + 아/어/여 + 도 돼요 > permission (could be used in both statement and question)

Verb + ~(으)면 돼요 > it works if (S) + (O) + V (one’s supposed to do something; or when politely asking the other person to do something)

Verb + ~(으)면 안 돼요

Statement > it doesn’t work if~

Question > asking for permission (plead, suggestion)

Verb + 아/어/여 + 도 안 돼요

> it doesn’t work even if~

> even (verb) isn’t allowed

Related Grammar:

Verb +아/어 도 = even if Verb

> to be okay even if (S) + (O) + Verb

> it’s okay to Verb (expressing permission)

> that still works / that’s fine too (conceding)

Noun 이/가 되다

    to become Noun
    for Noun to work

그러면 > (S) + (O) + Verb + (으)면 + (S) + (O) + V = If the first sentence happens, the second sentence happens too.

아무리 + Verb / Adjective > no matter how much Verb / Adjective""",

        "Lesson 14. Expressing Intention “In order to” -(으)려고 vs (으)러 / -게 vs -도록",
    category: "B3",
    text: """Review Note]

The most common way to say your intention is by using the construction: 

VERB STEM + (으)려고 

This translates to “in order to VERB” or more simply “to VERB”. 

 

(으)려고 separates the intention and the action such that, it forms the pattern: 

Intention + (으)려고 + Action 

 

e.g.,  

한국어를 잘하려고 매일 공부해요 – In order to be good at Korean, I study everyday 

  

운동하려고 헬스장에 갈 거예요 – I will go to the gym to work out  

 

일찍 일어나려고 일찍 잤어요 – I slept early to wake up early  

 

It is also possible to express intention with the construction: 

VERB STEM + (으)러 

 

This uses the same pattern as above and has the same meaning. 

e.g., 요리하러 부엌에 갔어요 – I went to the kitchen to cook  

 

*If the stem ends in 받침, use: Stem + (으)려고/(으)러 

If the stem doesn’t end in 받침, use:  Stem + 려고/러

Differences in usage  between (으)려고 vs (으)러 :

 

These two constructions have the same meanings but are NOT always interchangeable.  

 

Difference 1: 

 

VERB STEM + (으)려고 can be followed by clauses with ANY verbs (including movement verbs)

VERB STEM + (으)러 can only be followed by clauses with MOVEMENT verbs (e.g., 가다(to go) / 오다(to come) ) 

 

For example, (으)려고 and (으)러 can both be used in the phrase below because of the following movement verb. 

운동하려고 헬스장에 갈 거예요 (O) vs. 운동하러 헬스장에 갈 거예요 (X)

= I will go to the gym to work out.

 

However, only (으)려고 can be used here since it is not followed by a movement verb.  

한국어를 잘하려고 매일 공부해요 (O) vs. 한국어를 잘하러 매일 공부해요 (X) 

=In order to be good at Korean, I study everyday.

More examples: 

 
Phrase  	(으)려고  	(으)러

Irregular combinations to be aware of :

 

When irregular verbs with ㄷ 받침 (e.g., 듣다) are combined with these conjunctions, the 받침changes from a ㄷ to a ㄹ to aid pronunciation. In this way, using the verb 듣다 as an example, the stem added to (으)려고 or (으)러 would change from듣- to 들- before the conjunction was added. This forms 들으려고 or 들으러.  

 

e.g., 음악을 들으려고 조용한 방에 갔어요 – I went to a quiet room to listen to music 

 

Additionally, irregular verbs ending with ㄹ 받침, don’t need the extra 으when the constructions are added. This forms, using the verb 놀다 as an example, 놀려고 or 놀러 instead of 놀으러 or 놀으려고.  

 

Difference 2: 

 

Another difference between the 2 constructions is that (으)려고 can NOT be followed by phrases/verbs in the *imperative mood whereas (으)러 can.   

*Refers to an invitation, command, suggestion or request etc. (e.g., Come. Don’t speak, Let’s go. Please eat.)

 

e.g.,  

Please come to listen to music – 음악을 들으러 오세요 (O) NOT 음악을 들으려고 오세요 (X) 

Come visit my house* – 우리 집에 놀러 와 (O) NOT  우리 집에 놀려고 와  (X)

 

*Note:  This phrase is commonly used as a friendly way to invite someone to visit where you live, for example meaning “Come visit__” or “Come over to ___ for a visit”. It is formed using the combination of the verb 놀다 and the construction (으)러 and so literally translates to “come to play”. 

놀러 오세요 > 놀러 와요 > 놀러 와 (in decreasing order of formality) 

e.g., 언제 한국에 놀러 오세요 – Come visit Korea someday 

 

 

 

 

Imperative mood for verbs other than movement verbs  

 

Since the use of (으)러 is limited to movement verbs, the above use of the imperative mood is also limited to movement verbs. Because of this, other constructions must be used to express your intention when verbs other than the movement verbs are in the imperative mood. 

 

This can either be achieved by using the constructions: 

VERB STEM + 게 or VERB STEM + 도록  (they are interchangeable)

Usage 1 : When the action verb is in the imperative mood (except from 가다/오다) 

e.g., 

좋은 성적을 받게 공부해 / 좋은 성적을 받도록 공부해 – Study to get a good grade.  

내일 일찍 일어나게 일찍 자/ 내일 일찍 일어나도록 일찍 자 – Sleep early to get up early tomorrow. 

 

Usage 2: When the intention’s subject and the action’s subject are DIFFERENT.  

This is often the case for sentences in the imperative mood, since the subject of the imperative is the other person, referred to as ‘you’.  

e.g.,  

모두가 듣도록** 크게 말해 – Speak loudly so everyone can hear.

 

제가 이해하게 쉽게 써주세요 – Please write easily (/clearly) so I can understand.

**Note: With these 2 constructions(게 & 도록), the extra으 used for verb stems with 받침and the conversion of 듣다 to 들 (as mentioned above) is NOT necessary. 

 

As well as the above usages, 게 and 도록can also be used with plain sentences (not in the imperative). Here, the subjects of the intention and action phrases are still in disagreement. 

 

e.g.,  

저는 모두가 듣도록 크게 말했어요 – I spoke loudly so everyone could hear.

 

제프는 내가 슬프지 않도록 위로해줬어요 – Jeff consoled me so I wouldn’t be sad.

 

저는 가족들이 저녁을 먹을 수 있도록 집에 일찍 갈 거예요 – I will go home early so my family can eat dinner.""",

Pretty much all constructions that have “려” in it, like “Verb-(으)려고” that we have learned in the previous lesson and Verb-(으)려면 that we’re going to learn today, it has a meaning of “intention.”

 

    그러려면:

그러려면 means ‘If one wants / intends to…’ It is commonly used while giving or asking for advice.

It often translates to “in order to” in English, but it more means “If you want to~” or “If that’s what you intend to do/achieve.”

 

Hope/Plan/Intention + 그러면 + Required action (Result)

Ex. BTS를 만나고 싶어요. 그러려면 어디에 가야 돼요? = I want to meet BTS. To do that, where should I go?

 

To use 그러면 as a Conjunction:

Base Verb+(으)려면

Ex. 살을 빼려면 운동을 열심히 해야 돼요 = In order to lose weight, you should exercise hard.

Ex. 한국어를 잘하려면 공부를 열심히 하세요 = In order to be good at Korean, you should study hard.

Ex. 지갑을 찾으려면 어디에 신고해야 해요? = In order to find my wallet, where should I report it?

Ex. 가수가 되려면 어떻게 해야 돼요? = In order to become a singer, what should I do?

Ex. 늦지 않으려면 일찍 나가 = In order not to get late, go out early.

Ex. 감기가 빨리 나으려면* 무슨 약을 먹어야 해요? = In order to quickly get better from my cold, what medicine should I take?

You add 으려고 to a verb stem ending in a consonant, and 려고 to a stem ending in a vowel.

한국어를 공부하다 + ~(으)려고 + 하다 > 한국어를 공부하려고 이 책을 샀어요. – I bought this book in order to study Korean.

케밥을 먹다 + ~(으)려고 + 하다 > 케밥을 먹으려고 터키 레스토랑에 갔어요. – In order to eat 케밥 I went to a Turkish restaurant.

친구한테 주다 + ~(으)려고 + 하다 > 친구한테 주려고 편지를 썼어요. – I wrote a letter in order to give it to a friend.

 

When Verb-(으)려고 is followed by 하다(to do) verb, it can mean :

Verb-(으)려고 (in order to) + 하다 (to do) : to do (something) in order to verb

A: 이거 왜 했어요? – Why did you do that?

B: 시간을 때우려고 했어요. – I did that in order to kill time.

시간 때우다: to kill time

However, when Verb-(으)려고 하다 is a sentence ending, it has very little to do with Verb-(으)려고 (in order to), and has different meanings of its own.

 

Verb-(으)려고 하다’s THREE main meanings as a sentence ending

    to plan to (going to)

When Verb-(으)려고 하다 means “to plan to,” usually the verb is conjugated in present tense -(으)려고 해요, because you’re sharing what you are currently planning to do in the future. It’s often used with the first-person subject “I” or “We.”

오늘 라이브 수업을 하려고 해요. – I plan to do a live class today. / I’m going to do a live class today.

내일 일찍 일어나려고 해요. – I plan to wake up early tomorrow. / I’m going to wake up early tomorrow.

오늘 점심을 안 먹으려고 해요. – I’m planning on not having lunch today. / I’m not going to have lunch today.

오늘은 쉬는 날이라서 지난 주에 산 책을 읽으려고 해요. – Today is my day off, so I plan to read a book that I bought last week.

쉬는 날 / 휴일: a day off

 

Verb-(으)려고 해요 can be contracted to :

오늘 라이브 수업을 하려고요. 

내일 일찍 일어나려고요.

오늘 점심을 안 먹으려고요.

오늘은 쉬는 날이라서 지난 주에 산 책을 읽으려고요.

As you can see, 해 is removed from Verb-(으)려고 해요, and 요 ending is attached to 고 without spacing.

However, this contraction form CANNOT be used with 2nd or 3rd person subjects.

 

~(으)려고 해요 and ~(으)려고요 are interchangeable only when it’s present tense and only when the subject is the first person (I, We.). 
The only subtle difference would be that ~(으)려고요 sounds lighter.

이따가 한국어 수업을 [들으려고 해요 / 듣으려고 해요.] I plan to take Korean classes later today.

*when ~(으)려고 하다 is combined with a verb stem ending in ㄷ, ㄷ changes to ㄹ. This is one of the irregular verbs.

 

Let’s look at more irregular verbs:

1) ㄷ ending stem + (으)려고

ㄷ is replaced by ㄹ and you add 으:

듣다 (to listen) > 들으려고 하다

걷다 (to walk) > 걸으려고 하다 > 공원에서 잠깐 걸으려고 해요. – I plan to walk in the park for a while.

Note that not all ㄷ ending stems follow this irregular rule:

받다 (to receive) > 받으려고

To find out which verbs are irregular and which are not, you can check out our lesson on Irregular Verbs.

2) ㄹ ending stem + (으)려고

When a verb stem ends in ㄹ, you don’t add 으 – you simply add 려고.

물다 (to bite) > 물려고

만들다 (to make) > 만들려고

3) ㅂ ending stem + (으)려고

ㅂ gets deleted and 우 is added:

줍다 (to pick up) > 주우려고

굽다 (to bake) > 구우려고 

4) ㅅ ending stem + (으)려고

ㅅ gets deleted and you add 으려고.

짓다 (to build / to write / to name) > 지으려고 

붓다 (to pour) > 부으려고

 

    To be about to

The second meaning is “to be about to,” and can be conjugated in present, past, and future tense. Usually used with the first-person subject.

1) Present Tense : (으)려고 해요

이제 저는 자려고 해요 / 자려고요. 다음에 또 얘기해요. – I’m about to go to sleep now. Let’s chat again next time.

2) Past Tense:  (으)려고 했어요

방금 말 끊어서 미안해. 무슨 말을 하려고 했어? – Sorry, I just cut you off. What were you about to say?

A: 저는 내일 이사가요. – I’m moving.

B: 안 그래도 물어보려고 했어요. 이사 잘 하세요. – I was about to ask (even if you didn’t mention it). Goodbye on moving!

*안 그래도: even if you didn’t Verb~ (used in situations when you were about to talk about something, but the other person mentioned it first).

3) Future Tense:  (으)려고 할 거예요

지금 지수한테 말을 걸면 울려고 할 거예요. 시간을 좀 주세요. – If you start a conversation with Jisoo right now, she’ll be about to cry. Give her some time.

말을 걸다: to start a conversation / to initiate a talk

 

    To try to Verb

The last meaning of ~(으)려고 하다 is “to try to Verb” and it can be also conjugated into the present, past, and future tense. Any subject can be used.

Note, that when you want to express the meaning of “to try to Verb”, you can’t use ~(으)려고요 contraction. Otherwise, it’ll deliver the meaning of “to be going to / to be about to”.

1) Present Tense: (으)려고 해요

고양이가 저를 물려고 해요. – The cat is trying to bite me.

저 도둑이 도망가려고 해요. 막아야 되지 않을까요? – That thief is trying to run away. Shouldn’t we stop him?

도둑: a thief

도망가다: to run away

막다: to block sb / to stop sb

2) Past Tense : (으)려고 했어요

Past tense (으)려고 했다 is usually used when you imply that the attempt of doing something has failed.

그 사람이 저를 때리려고 했어요. 정말 나쁜 사람이에요. – That person tried to hit me (but he failed). He’s such a bad person.

새 폰을 사려고 했는데 너무 비싸요. 그래서 대신 중고폰을 샀어요. – I tried to buy a new phone, but it was too expensive. So instead, I bought a second-hand one.
중고: secondhand

지수는 약을 안 먹으려고 할 거예요. 약이 아니라 사탕이라고 거짓말하세요. – Jisoo will try not to take a pill. Say(Lie) that it’s a candy, not a pill.
거짓말하다: to lie

Other Similar Expressions:

– I’m going ta do a live class.

All these expressions are interchangeable, but Verb ~ㄹ/을 계획이다 and Verb ~ㄹ/을 예정이다 sound a bit more formal or serious.

    text:
        """When expressing your reasoning for doing or having something, the word 위해 can be used. It is combined with nouns and verbs slightly differently, but both come to have the meaning of “for the sake of…” or more simply, “for”.
NOUN	VERB
을/를 위해(서)	기 위해(서)
너를 위해 – for you	공부하기 위해(서) – for the sake of studying

Noun + 을/를 위해

 

Here, the noun attached to the construction can be a person, a thing or a goal.

Examples:

너를 위해 준비했어 – I prepared this for you.

시험 합격을 위해 열심히 공부하고 있어요 – I’m studying hard for the sake of passing the test.

방탄소년단은 “작은 것들을 위한 시”를 썼어요 – BTS wrote “a poem for the small things (Boy With Luv).”

할머니를 위해 어느 기념품을 살까요? – Which (one of these) souvenirs should I buy for my grandmother?

피자 요리를 위해 어떤 재료가 필요하니? – What kind of ingredients to you need for cooking pizza?

건강을 위해 수술을 받았어요 – I got/underwent the surgery for my health.

 

Verb + 기 위해(서)

 

Again, the verb attached to this construction would act as the goal of the sentence. However, because of this, it can be more natural to translate the phrase as “in order to verb” or “to verb” instead of “for the sake of verb”.

시험에 합격하기 위해서 열심히 공부하고 있어요 – I’m studying hard to pass the test.

아침에 일찍 일어나기 위해서 알람을 맞췄어요 – I set the alarm in order to wake up early in the morning.

교통 체증을 피하기 위해서 매일 걸어서 출근해요 – I walk to work every day to avoid traffic congestion.

남동생을 돌보기 위해 친구랑 계획을 취소했어 – I cancelled my plans with my friends to take care of my younger brother.

NB: -기 is used here for verb nominalisation and the 위해서 is commonly shortened to 위해.

When used with adjectives, it is common to use the “present tense + 지” form since it is your goal to get to/reach that state (to become adjective). Therefore, the “to become adjective” form is used, and it can be more directly translated as this or instead more simply as “to be”.

따뜻해지기 위해서 이불을 덮었어요 – I covered myself in a blanket in order to become warm.

남자친구가 건강해지기 위해 짠 음식을 안 먹어 – My boyfriend doesn’t eat salty food in order to become healthy.

 

Difference between –기 위해서 and (으)려고

 

Because of this construction’s meaning, it can be used in the same way as (으)려고, but sounds a bit more formal and makes the goal sound more important/heavy than (으)려고.

As well as this, 기 위해(서) can be used with imperatives and suggestion (e.g., Let’s…) clauses whereas (으)려고 cannot. These clauses include:

Present tense + 야 해요 – (I) have to…

(으)ㅂ시다 – Let’s…

(으)세요 – Polite imperative

(으)ㄹ까요? – Shall we…?

Examples:

 

아침에 일찍 일어나기 위해서 알람을 맞췄어요 – I set the alarm (in order) to wake up early in the morning.  

=

아침에 일찍 일어나려고 알람을 맞췄어요 – I set the alarm (in order) to wake up early in the morning.

    title: "Lesson 20. Verb/Adj-게 되다 : Change & What ended up happening",
    category: "B3",
    text: """1.      Change

-게 되다 is used when you want to express changes in your (or someone’s) situation/condition/state.

For example:

직장 때문에 한국에 가게 됐어요. – I am moving to Korea because of work.

In this example, you are moving to Korea and that is the change. 
So you can combine 한국에 가다(to go/move to Korea) + 게 되다. (게 되다 is usually conjugated is in the past tense.)

The same pattern can also be used when you want to talk about your skills that have changed.

처음에는 한글도 몰랐는데 지금은 한국어를 잘 하게 됐어요. (잘 하다 + 게 됐어요) – At first, I didn’t even know Hangul, but now I am good at Korean.

You can use a simple present tense conjugation to say that your Korean has become better (지금은 한국어를 잘 해요), but if you want to emphasize the change in a situation, you can use -게 되다.

 

    What ended up happening

Another usage of -게 되다 is when you want to express what ended up happening. This usage can be applied when talking about both positive and negative things. 

기차는 예약이 다 차서 어쩔 수 없이. 버스를 타게 됐어요. – The train is fully booked, so I have no choice. I ended up taking a bus. 

우연히 빅키 선생님의 유튜브 채널을 발견하게 됐어요. – I coincidently happened to discover teacher’s Vicky YouTube channel.

그래서 한 달 동안 빅키 선생님의 영상으로 공부를 했고 지금은 많은 문장을 이해할 수 있게 됐어요. – So I studied with teacher Vicky’s videos for a month, and I ended up being able to understand many sentences.

카페에서 공부하면 더 열심히 공부하게 돼요. – When you study in a cafe, you end up studying harder.

 

    Adjective –아/어지다 and Adjective –게 되다

Adjectives can be combined with the ~게 되다 grammar pattern as well as verbs, but ~게 되다 usually go with verbs.

The translation of the “Adjective + ~게 되다” combination is usually “something has changed to being an adjective”.

You might have noticed that “Adjective + ~게 되다” is similar to another grammar pattern Adjective -아/어지다, which means “to become Adjective”.

방을 청소해서 깨끗하게 됐어요 / 깨끗해졌어요. – I cleaned my room, so it (became) clean.

Both ~아/어지다 and ~게 되다 are grammatically correct to use in the sentence above, but native Korean speakers tend to use ~아/어지다 with adjectives more often.

 

    Verb –게 하다 vs Verb –게 되다

Verb -게 하다 means “to make somebody do Verb”.

하다 means “to do,” whereas 되다 means “to become” and it’s also a passive form of 하다(to do) and means “to be done.”

So Verb -게 되다, if you break it down, literally means that “something is done in a way you Verb.” Therefore, “it ended up verb-ing.”

선생님은 학생들이 공부를 더 열심히 하게 했어요. – Teacher made students to study harder.

선생님 덕분에 학생들이 공부를 더 열심히 하게 됐어요. Thanks to the teacher, the students ended up studying harder. 

 

    Not used in Natural Phenomenon

비가 오게 됐어요.(X) – an incorrect sentence; instead you can say it like this:

비가 와요 / 오네요. – It’s raining.

    category: "B3",
    text:
        """When offering suggestions in Korean, the word 어때 can be used to mean “Why don’t we/you…?” or “How about we/you…?”. This combines with nouns and verbs slightly differently as follows:

NOUN
	VERB

N + 어때(요)?
	

STEM + 는 것 어때(요)?
사과 어때요? – how about an apple?	

먹는 것 어때요? – how about eating?

As you can see, in both cases, 어때요 can be combined directly with nouns. This is why, when combined with verbs, the noun (nominalised) form of the verb is used instead of the verb directly.

As previously shown, this noun form is commonly shortened to 는 거 when spoken and 은/는, 이/가 markers can be added and form contractions with this. Common examples include:

는 거 + 이/가 -> 는 게

는 거 + 은/는 -> 는 거는 -> 는 건 (adds emphasis or contrast)

 

When saying ‘Noun + 어때요?’ you can also mark the Noun with topic markers (은/는) and subject markers (이/가).

e.g.
오늘 저녁 일찍 먹는 거 어때요? How about we have dinner early today?
=오늘 저녁 일찍 먹는 게 (먹는 거 + 가) 어때요?
오늘 저녁 일찍 먹는 건 (먹는 거 + 는) 어때요? (adds more emphasis, or implies contrast)

사과 어때요? How about an apple?
=사과가 어때요?
사과는 어때요? (adds emphasis, or implies contrast)

 

NB: 는 것 is added directly to verb stems regardless of 받침 (e.g., 먹는 것 and 하는 것). However, when added to irregular verb stems with ㄹ 받침, the ㄹis deleted from the verb stem before 는 거 can be added.

e.g., 만들다 -> 우리가 직접 케잌을 만드는 거 어때요? – How about we make the cake ourselves?

      놀다 -> 주말엔 일하지 말고 노는 게 어때요? – On the weekend, why don’t we hang out instead of work?

 

Example sentences

일단 먹고 얘기하는 게 어때요? – Why don’t we eat first and then talk?

다시 해보는 거 어때요? – Why don’t you try again?

8시 말고 6시에 만나는 거 어때요? – How about meeting at 6pm instead of 8pm?

오늘은 사과 2 개만 사는 거 어때요? – How about we only buy 2 apples today?

언니한테 전화해보는 게 어때요? – Why don’t you try calling your older sister?

이 가방이 너무 비싼데 이거는 어때요? – This bag is too expensive. What about this one?

이렇게 하는 건 어때요? – Why don’t we do it like this?

제가 주중에 시간 되는데… 목요일 어때요? – I’m free on the weekdays, how about Thursday?

A: 뭘 사는 게 좋을까요? – What shall I buy?
B: 이 귀걸이 어때요? – How about this earring? [귀걸이: earring]

 

It is also possible to add -ㄹ/을까? to this construction (=어떻다 + ㄹ/을까(요) = 어떨까(요)?) to add an extra level of the ‘shall we…?” and possibly sound comparatively less insistent or opinionated. 

e.g., 이번에는 막걸리를 마시는 거 어떨까요? – Why don’t we drink makgeolli this time?

지난 주에 태국 음식을 먹었으니까 오늘은 일본 음식을 먹는 게 어떨까요? – Since we had Thai food last week, why don’t we try Japanese food today?

피곤해 보이시는데 오늘은 그냥 쉬시는 게 어떨까요? – You look tired, so why don’t you just take a rest for today?""",

    category: "B3",
    text: """1. Verb-ㄹ/을까(요)?

‘Verb-ㄹ/을까(요)’ is used when you are asking yourself a question or are unsure about something. It most commonly translates to: ‘I wonder…’

Ex. 주말에 뭐 할까? = I wonder what I should do on the weekend…

Ex. 아빠가 괜찮을까? = I wonder if dad will be okay…

When used in such context, the question of doing the verb is not directed at someone in particular.

 

However, it can also be used when:

a) Making a suggestion for us to do (Shall we~?)

Ex. 다 먹었으니까 이제 갈까요? = Now that we are done eating, shall we go?

Ex. 공부를 시작해 볼까? = Shall we start studying?

 

b) Asking if something is right/okay for me or someone to do (Shall I~?, Would it be okay if I~?)

Ex. 한국에 1년 더 있을까? = Shall I stay in Korea for a year more?

Ex. 이렇게 하면 괜찮을까요? = Would it be okay to do like this?

Ex. 몸이 편찮으시면 집에서 쉬시는 게 낫지 않을까요? If you are sick, wouldn’t it be better to stay home?

 

    Verb-ㄹ/을래(요)?

‘Verb-ㄹ/을래’ is another grammar pattern that is used quite similarly as the ‘Verb-ㄹ/을까’ grammar i.e., to make suggestions. It can be translated as ‘Do you want to…?’ or ‘Would you like to…?’

Ex. 오늘은 등산 갈래요? = Would you like to go hiking?

Ex. 나랑 같이 밥 먹으러 갈래? = Would you like to go eat food with me?

Ex. 우리 집에 올래요? = Do you want to come to my house?

 

When both Verb-ㄹ/을까 and -ㄹ/을래 have the meaning of making suggestions, it is possible to use them interchangeably in some cases like 

Ex. 영화 볼까요? = Shall we watch a movie? (Do you think it’s a good idea?)

Ex. 영화 볼래요? = Do you want to watch a movie? (Inviting someone to watch a movie with me)

Both the above sentences convey practically the same meaning, and hence either of the two grammar structures can be used.

Ex. 햄버거 시킬까요? = Shall we order a hamburger?

or 햄버거 시킬래요? = Do you want to order a hamburger?

 

When both are used as suggestions, the subtle difference between the two forms would be that ‘Verb-ㄹ/을까’ is closer to asking if something is a good idea, while ‘verb-ㄹ/을래’ has more of the meaning of inviting someone to do something. Also, -ㄹ/을까 is usually used when suggesting for “us” to do something, whereas -ㄹ/을래 can be used when suggesting both “we” and “you” do something.""",

    category: "B3",
    text:
        """The video above covers both -네(요) and 대(요). However, more grammar on -대(요) will be covered in depth in Intermediate 1 course. So you may skip the 대(요) part, and just focus on -네(요) for now.

 

‘-네(요)’ is a Sentence ending that is used when reporting what you observe or feel right now (your immediate reaction) to something you just heard/saw/experienced.

 

While using this sentence ending, it is implied that the Subject of the sentence is ‘I’ i.e., the speaker itself, so words like ‘저는, 제가, 나는, 내가’ must be omitted while using 네(요).

 

1. Using –네(요) ending:

Subject + Object + Verb/Adjective Stem (Reported Sentence)+네요.

Ex. 비가 오네 = It’s raining. (I see that it’s raining.)

Ex. 한국어를 잘하시네요 = You’re good at Korean. (I see that you’re Korean is good.)

Ex. 지수는 키가 크네요 = Jisoo is tall. (I see that Jisoo is tall.)

 

2. Uses of -네요 ending:

1) To report something that you’ve experienced/felt (right now or in the nearby past)

Ex. 옆집 아저씨가 불친절하네요 = (I feel like/can see that…) My neighbour is unkind.

Ex. 날씨가 좋지 않네요 = (I feel like/can see that…)The weather is not good.

2) To express surprise over a thing that you’ve just observed or realised.

Ex. 이 옷이 비싸네요! = These clothes are expensive!

Ex. 경치가 정말 예쁘네요 = The view is really pretty.

 

3) When complimenting someone.

Ex. 제프는 정말 똑똑하네요 = Jeff is really smart.

Ex. 동생은 매일 책을 읽어서 보기 좋네요 = It’s good to see that my sibling reads books every day.

 

Irregular Verbs :
Verb stems that end in ‘ㄹ’ 받침 are exceptions. To attach -네요 ending, simply delete the ‘ㄹ’ 받침 and add 네요.

Ex. 지수가 행복하게 사네요 = Jisoo lives happily. (살다 + 네요 = 사네요)

Ex. 너 지금 커피 만드네 = You are making coffee right now. (만들다 + 네요 = 만드네요)

Ex. 저 고양이는 매일 우네요 = That cat cries every day. (울다 + 네요 = 우네요)""",

It is a question embedded into a sentence. It is the object in a sentence that the speaker is unaware of.

Example:

INDIRECT QUESTIONS-

I want to know if/whether Jisoo likes me.  (Direct form = Does Jisoo like me?)

I am curious how difficult Korean is. (Direct form = How difficult is Korean?)

Do you know what this is? (Direct form = What is this?)

Do you know if Jisoo will come home? (Direct form = Will Jisoo come home?)

 

*

 

Step 1: Using Indirect Marker.

An indirect marker marks the unknown content in the sentence i.e., what you don’t know or would like to know. (Refer to the bold parts in the above examples.)

 

Step 2. Making sentences.

    Present Tense Verb : (S) + (O) + Verb + 는지

Ex. I am not sure if Jisoo is busy these days.

= 지수가 여즘 바쁜지 잘 모르겠어요.

 

Ex. I don’t know who is smarter.

  =  누가 더 똑똑한지 모르겠어요.

 

    이다 verb :

Noun 이다 = to be noun

=  그 사람이 한국 사람인지 모르겠어요.

 

Ex. I am not sure if that person is a woman.

  =  저 사람이 여자인지 모르겠어요.

Direct Quotation-

Ex. 저는 “지수가 매일 한국어를 공부해요” 라고 (말)했어요 = I said, “Jisoo studies Korean every day.”

 

Indirect Quotation-

Ex. 저는 지수가 매일 한국어를 공부한다고 했어요 = I said that Jisoo studies Korean every day.

Indirect Quotation basically is embedding one sentence into another sentence.

 

INDIRECT QUOTING A SENTENCE IN PRESENT TENSE:

    Verbs: Verb + ㄴ/는 다고

Ex. 아빠는 제프가 잘 먹는다고 했어요 = Dad said that Jeff eats well.

Ex. 저는 제프씨가 요리를 잘한다고 들었어요 = I heard that Mr. Jeff is good at cooking.

 

    Adjectives: Adj + 다고

Ex. (나는) 지수가 착하다고 생각해 = I think that Jisoo is nice.

Ex. 제프는 지수가 예쁘다고 했어요 = Jeff said that Jisoo is pretty.

 

* ‘있다/없다’ use the Adjective rule despite being verbs!

Ex. 네가 요즘 한국어를 배우고 있다고 들었어 = I heard that you are learning Korean these days.

 

    Nouns (이다): Noun + (이)라고

Ex. 저는 학생이라고 했어요 = I said that I am a student.

Ex. 네가 천사라고 생각해 = I think that you are an angel.

 

* -(이)라고 is also commonly used along with names, when introducing oneself.

Ex. 저는 제프라고 합니다 = My name is Jeff.

 

    Negated Verbs/Adjectives/이다:

    Verbs-

Ex. 내 남자친구가 매운 음식을 안 좋아한다고 했어 = My boyfriend said that he does not like spicy food.

Or- 내 남자친구가 매운 음식을 좋아하지 않는다고 했어 = My boyfriend said that he does not like spicy food.

 

    Adjectives-

Ex. 오늘 날씨가 안 춥다고 생각해요 = I think that today’s weather is not cold.

    이다-

Ex. 지수는 고향은 서울이 아니라고 했어요 = Jisoo said that her hometown is not Seoul.

*

 

INDIRECT QUOTING A SENTENCE IN PAST TENSE:

Verbs/Adjectives/이다 + 았/었/였 + 다고

Ex. 엄마는 아빠가 잠이 들었다고 생각해요 = Mom thinks that dad fell asleep.

Ex. 내 친구가 어제 안 추었다고 했어 = My friend said that it wasn’t cold yesterday.

Ex. 지수네 아빠가 변호사였다고 들었어요 = I heard that Jisoo’s dad used to be a lawyer.

*

 

INDIRECT QUOTING A SENTENCE IN FUTURE TENSE:

Verb + ㄹ/을 거라고

Ex. 지수가 앞으로 열심히 공부할 거라고 했어 = Jisoo said that she will study hard from now on.

Ex. 내일 비가 올 거라고 했어= I said it might rain tomorrow.

 

INTERCHANGING FUTURE AND PRESENT TENSE

    Interchangeable when talking about someone’s plan, determination or something that’s supposed to happen.

Ex. 지수가 앞으로 열심히 공부할 거라고 했어 = 지수가 앞으로 열심히 공부한다고 했어.

(Jisoo said that she will study hard from now on.)

Ex. 엄마가 곧 올 거라고 악속했어요 = 엄마가 곧 온다고 악속했어요

(Mom promised she will come soon.)

The above two sentences contain someone’s plan or determination of an action and so it is possible to interchange the future tense with the present.

 

    Not interchangeable when talking about predictions that aren’t 100% certain.

Ex. 내일 비가 올 거라고 했어= I said it might rain tomorrow.

Ex. 지수가 내일 아마 안 잘 거라고 생각해요 = I think that Jisoo might not sleep tomorrow.

In the above two sentences, since these are strong predictions, it is not possible to interchange the future tense with the present.

(this video only covers present tense, but in the review note below, you can also learn about past and future tense.)

 

 

In today’s lesson, you will learn a new expression -것 같다 and its meaning.

Before we start, make sure that you have already learned how to combine a sentence or a verb/adjective with 것 to turn it into a noun. (Verb’s Nominalization Lesson)

 

~것 같아요 > ~것 (the fact that, the thing) + 같다 (adj. to be same / to be like): it seems that, I think that …

 

So, when combining a sentence or a verb/adjective with ~것 같다 you turn a sentence or a verb into a noun:

(S) + (O) + Verb + ㄴ/는/은/ㄹ/을 + 것 같다: I think / It seems that (S + O + V)

 

~것 같다 is similar to ~고 생각하다, in that both can be used to express your thought.

 

The differences are that,

~고 생각하다 is a stronger expression,
whereas ~것 같다 is softer and less opinionated. 것 같다 is also used to state what seems to be like, rather than your firm opinion.

Also, 것 같다 can only be used to express “my” thought and what seems to be like to “me.” It cannot be used to express someone else’s thoughts, and that’s different from -고 생각하다.

 

Just for review, ~고 생각하다’s present tense construction goes like this:

Adjective  + 다고 생각하다

이다 Verb > 라 (X 받침) / 이라 (O 받침) + ~고 생각하다

Verb Stem + ㄴ (X 받침) / 는 (O 받침) + ~고 생각하다

 

Now let’s look at how the grammar construction works with  -는 것 같다.

 

1. Present Tense

    Adjective / 이다 + ㄴ / 은 것 같다 
    Verb + 는 것 같다
    *ㄹ ending irregular verb : (delete ㄹ받침)
    **adjectives that have 있다 / 없다 in it also follow verb’s rule

 

Let’s look at some examples:

친구가 아픈 것 같아요. – It seems my friend is sick. (adjective)

지수가 노래를 듣는 것 같아요. – Jisoo seems to be listening to music. (verb)

이 영화가 재미있는 것 같아요. I think this movie is fun. (있다 ending adjective)

지수가 서울에 사는 것 같아요. It seems Jisoo lives in Seoul. (ㄹ ending adjective)

 

 

1) Adjectives with ~것 같다

제프가 똑똑한 것 같아요 (= 저는 제프가 똑똑하다고 생각해요.) – It seems that Jeff is smart. / I think Jeff is smart.

저는 지수가 예쁜 것 같아요 (=저는 지수가 예쁘다고 생각해요.) – It seems / I think that Jisoo is pretty.

한국어가 재미있는 것 같아요 (=한국어가 재미있다고 생각해요.) – It seems / I think Korean is interesting.

한국어가 어려운 것 같아요 (=한국어가 어렵다고 생각해요.) – It seems / I think Korean is difficult.

*어렵다 > 어려 + 운 > 어려운

저는 배가 안 부른 것 같아요 (=저는 배가 안 부르다고 생각해요.) – It seems / I think I’m not full.

 

2) 이다 with ~것 같다

저는 제프가 천재인 것 같아요 (=저는 제프가 천재라고 생각해요.) – I think Jeff is a genius.

저는 지수가 미인인 것 같아요 (=저는 지수가 미인이라고 생각해요.) – I think Jisoo is beautiful.

한국어가 재미있는 언어인 것 같아요 (=한국어가 재미있는 언어라고 생각해요.) – I think Korean is an interesting language.

한국어가 어려운 언어인 것 같아요 (=한국어가 어려운 언어라고 생각해요.) – I think Korean is a difficult language.

 

3) Verb with ~것 같다

저는 제프가 지수를 좋아하는 것 같아요 (=저는 제프가 지수를 좋아한다고 생각해요.) – It seems/ I think that Jeff likes Jisoo.

제프가 한국어를 잘하는 것 같아요 (=제프가 한국어를 잘한다고 생각해요.) – It seems / I think that Jeff is good at Korean.

        """-거든(요) is a sentence ending that is attached right after a Verb or Adjective. It can have various meanings:

 

    When -거든(요) means ‘Because’:

It is used to provide information previously unknown to the listener or to provide reason for the sentence it is being attached to.

Ex. 저는 한국 드라마를 자주 봐요. 요즘 한국어를 배우고 있거든요 = I watch Korean drama often, because I’m learning Korean these days.

Ex. – 왜 늦었어? = Why are you late?

      – 늦잠을 잤거든… = Because I slept in…

Ex. 저는 못 가요. 밖에 비가 오거든요 = I can’t go because it’s raining outside.

 

    When -거든(요) is a Conversation Opener:

When used in this context, -거든(요) is attached to the first sentence of one’s speech. The sentences that follow are relevant to that first sentence where -거든(요) is used. Often the tone of -거든(요) is raised, almost as if adding a question mark.

Ex. 최근에 집을 샀거든요? 되게 넓어요. = I recently bought a house. It’s very spacious!

Ex. 내가 어제 그 카페에 갔거든? 그런데 우연히 지수를 만난 거 있지! 너무 반가웠어 = I went to that coffee shop yesterday and chanced upon Jisoo! It was so nice to see her.

This ending is also commonly used to strongly refute what the other person has said in order to express your disagreement with them.

Ex. – 네가 168cm라고? 더 작은 것 같은데… = You say you’re 168cm tall? But I think you’re shorter than that…

      –  168cm 맞거든요! = I am 168cm!

        "Lesson8. Verb-던 : Past-tense Modifier for Unfinished or Repeated action",
    category: "I1",
    text: """1. Verb-던

Today, we’re gonna look at the usages of Verb-던, which can be classified as a “past-tense modifier form” of verbs.

But then, how about Verb-ㄴ/은? (Lesson on verb’s modifier form : https://explorekorean.net/beginner2-lesson12/) Haven’t we learned that Verb-ㄴ/은 is a past tense modifier form of verbs?

How are Verb-ㄴ/은 different from Verb-던? 

Let’s look at the following examples first.

아빠가 먹은 피자
아빠가 먹던 피자

The first one (아빠가 먹은 피자) means “the pizza I ate.” Here, 먹다(to eat) is a one-time action that happened in the past.

The second one (아빠가 먹던 피자) means something more specific, and it has three possible meanings : 

    the pizza that Dad was eating (but hasn’t finished yet.)
    the pizza that Dad used to eat on a regular basis (not anymore)
    the pizza that Dad has been eating regularly up to this time (you’re not sure whether he’ll continue to eat that pizza on a regular basis)

So you can notice that Verb-던 has mainly three usages :

    An action that started in the past but hasn’t ended yet (action left undone) 
    An action that one used to do continuously/regularly/repeatedly (and not anymore)
    An action that one’s been doing continuously/regularly/repeatedly up to this time (but will not likely continue. It’s also used when you’re not sure whether that action will continue.)

From this, you can figure out the three possible meanings each following phrase can have. 

엄마가 읽던 책 

    the book that mom was reading (but she hasn’t finished it yet.)
    the book that mom used to read regularly
    the book that mom’s been reading regularly

아빠가 쓰던 노트북

    the laptop that dad was using (but hasn’t finished using it yet, he has more to do with that laptop)
    the laptop that dad used to use regularly
    the laptop that dad’s been using regularly

재미있게 보던 드라마

    the drama that I was enjoying watching (but hasn’t finished yet)
    the drama that I used to enjoy watching regularly
    the drama that I’ve been watching regularly up to this time

So now we know all the possible meanings of Verb-던.

But how do we know which one of these three 던 means in a certain phrase or sentence?

A. You can figure it out from the general context.

e.g.

TV가 망가져서 재미있게 보던 드라마를 더 이상 보지 못해요.

이거 내가 마시던 커피인데, 네가 다 마실래?

남이 먹던 음식은 별로 먹고 싶지 않아요.

자주 오시던 손님이 안 보이네요.

설리가 키우던 고양이를 김희철이 키우고 있어요.

B. You can get the most obvious hint from the time adverbs.

e.g.

엄마가 어제 읽던 책 : The book that mom started reading yesterday but hasn’t finished yet

=> From the adverb 어제, you know that the action “읽다(to read)” started yesterday. So it cannot mean “regularly.” The only possible meaning would have to be “the book that mom started reading yesterday, but hasn’t finished yet.” 

이거 동생이 쓰던 노트북이네. 요즘도 쓰나? : This is the laptop that my younger sibling’s been using. Does he still use it?

=> 요즘도 (요즘: these days + 도: as well) 쓰나? is a question that indicates the speaker isn’t sure whether he still uses it these days. So 동생이 쓰던 노트북 here would mean “the laptop that my younger sibling’s been using.

“주말마다 재미있게 보던 드라마가 오늘 끝난대요.” 

=> 주말마다 means every weekend. The very phrase implies the regularity of the action. Also, it says the drama ends (끝나다) today (오늘.) So the sentence above should mean “I hear the drama that I’ve been watching every weekend ends today.”

C. You can also narrow down the meaning by paying attention to the nature of the verb that’s attached to -던.

Let’s look at the following six phrases:

1) 옆집에 살던 사람 (살다: to live + 던)

    the person who was living next door (but she hasn’t finished living yet) — this doesn’t make sense, since living is not an action that can be left undone. So we can omit this.
    the person who used to live next door (living is already something that happens continuously)
    the person who’s been living next door up to this time

So its possible meaning narrows down to 2) and 3).

e.g.
예전에 옆집에 살던 사람한테 최근에 연락이 왔어요.
The person that used to live next door reached out to me recently.

옆집에 살던 사람이 곧 이사를 간대요.
The person that’s been living next door said she will be moving out soon. 

2) 네가 입던 옷 (입다: to wear + 던)

    clothes you were putting on (but haven’t finished yet) — It’s quite unusual to refer to a piece of clothing that someone hasn’t even finished putting on. So we can leave this out.
    clothes that you used to wear regularly 
    clothes that you’ve been wearing regularly up to this time

Its possible meaning narrows down to 2) and 3).

e.g. 
이거 네가 자주 입던 옷 아니야?
Aren’t these clothes that you used to wear often?
Aren’t these clothes that you’ve been wearing often? 

To make it even more clear which one of the above two you mean, you can add an adverb that points to a specific time or time frame.

이거 네가 어렸을 때 자주 입던 옷 아니야? (어렸을 때: when one was young, during childhood)
Aren’t these clothes what you used to wear often when you were young?

이거 네가 요즘 자주 입던 옷 아니야? (요즘 : these days)
Aren’t these clothes what you’ve been wearing often these days?

3) 우리가 가던 식당 (가다: to go + 던)

    the restaurant we were going (but haven’t finished yet) — Also quite unusual, so leave it out. If you are meaning to say “the restaurant that you were headed to but haven’t arrived,” it’s better to use “가고 있던 (present progressive + 던)” rather than “가던.”
    the restaurant we used to go regularly 
    the restaurant we’ve been going regularly up to this time

e.g. 

A: 오늘은 어디에서 저녁을 먹을까요? Where should we have dinner tonight?
B: 우리가 평소에 자주 가던 식당 어때요? How about the place we usually go often?
(평소에: at usual times, usually)

학생 때 자주 가던 식당이 문을 닫았대요. I heard that the restaurant I used to go often in my student years closed down. 

4) 내가 다니던 학교 [다니다: to frequent a place (as a member of that place; usually used for work, school or somewhere that requires a membership)]

The nature of the verb 다니다 is that, just like 살다(to live), it’s not something that can be left undone. You either frequent a place, or not. So you can leave out the option “the school that I was frequenting (but left undone)” since that doesn’t make any sense at all.

e.g.

여긴 내가 다니던 학교야. This is a school I used to attend. 
지금까지 다니던 직장을 그만뒀어요. I quit my job (that I’ve been having so far.) 

5) 지수가 좋아하던 남자애

    the boy that Jisoo was liking (?) but haven’t finished? — doesn’t make any sense, so leave it out.
    the boy that Jisoo used to like (when you like something, it’s naturally continuous)
    the boy that Jisoo has liked (up to the last time I remember)

내가 좋아하던 남자애의 이름이 기억이 안나요. I can’t remember the name of a boy that I used to like.
쟤는 지수가 좋아하던 남자애 아니에요? 아직도 좋아하나? Isn’t he a boy that Jisoo’s been liking (=Jisoo likes)? Does she still like him?

6) (place)에 있던 가방

    the bag that was being there but hasn’t finished? — doesn’t make any sense at all, so leave it out.
    the bag that used to be there (when something is there, it is there continuously)
    the bag that has been there (up to the last time I saw it)

여기 있던 가방 봤어요? Have you seen a bag that had been here (not anymore, it’s gone)?
열쇠는 식탁에 있던 가방에 있을 거예요. The key might be in a bag that has been on the table (up to the last time I saw it).

2. Adj-던
(-던 and -았/었던 are the only past-tense modifier of adjectives)

A girl with long hair was crying alone in the bus station.
(=머리가 길던 여자애)

Aren’t you that kind lady from yesterday?
(=친절하던 아주머니)

My dad who used to be fat lost a lot of weight and he’s now thin.
(=뚱뚱하던 아빠)

3. When Verb-던 is interchangeable with Verb-ㄴ/은

Although not as common as the three meanings we learned so far, Verb-던 can also be used when recollecting any past action that one did, regardless of regularity or completion.

In this case, it would be interchangeable with Verb-ㄴ/은. 

The difference, however, would be that using Verb-던 has a more recollective/retrospective nuance to it. 

e.g. 

어제 공원에서 울던 여자애 기억나? 

어제 공원에서 야옹대던 고양이를 또 보고 싶어요.

When -던 is used this way, due to its recollective nuance, it often appears in poetry or lyrics where they reminisce about something or someone from the past.  

e.g.

수줍게 꽃을 건네던 너에게
웃으며 손을 내밀었지

수줍게 인사를 건네던 너에게
살며시 입을 맞추었지

Lyrics from <<Love Story – Bol4>> 

=> You can replace 건네던 with 건넨, because it’s talking about past action that you recollect, it will lose its more endearing(?), memory-related nuance.

Now, let’s move on to V/A-았/었던""",
    link: "https://explorekorean.net/intermediate1-lesson8/",
  ),
  Lesson(
    title: "Lesson9. V/A-았/었던",
    category: "I1",
    text:
        """Let’s move on to the next grammar phrase that has “던” in it, but this time with -았/었.

-았/었 is past conjugation of verbs, thereby indicating completion of an event or action.

Therefore, -았/었던 is used to recollect something that 1) was the case in the past and not anymore (past state of affairs), or 2) past event or actions that ended or was completed.

Let’s look at the example sentences below.

1) Past State of Affairs

어렸을 때 아주 작았던 지수가 지금은 이렇게 컸네요. Jisoo, who used to be small, has grown this much now.

운동을 좋아했던 동생이 다리를 다쳐서 지금은 그렇게 활동적이지 않아요. My brother, who used to like playing sports, hurt his legs and is no longer very active.

이 집은 제가 어렸을 때 살았던 집이에요. This is the house I lived when I was young.

오랫동안 K-pop 팬이었던 제 동생은 더 이상 K-pop을 듣지 않아요. My brother, who had been a long-time fan of K-pop, no longer listens to K-pop music.

Each sentence above indicates recollection of a past state of affairs that hasn’t continued to the present.

Here, you may have noticed that 작다(to be small), 좋아하다(to like), 살다(to live) and 이다(to be) in each sentence express a degree of continued state.

Therefore, it can be replaced with ‘-던’ without changing any meaning.

어렸을 때 아주 작았던 지수가 지금은 이렇게 컸네요. = 어렸을 때 아주 작던 지수가 지금은 이렇게 컸네요.

운동을 좋아했던 동생이 다리를 다쳐서 지금은 그렇게 활동적이지 않아요. = 운동을 좋아하던 동생이 다리를 다쳐서 지금은 그렇게 활동적이지 않아요.

이 집은 제가 어렸을 때 살았던 집이에요. = 이 집은 제가 어렸을 때 살던 집이에요.

오랫동안 K-pop 팬이었던 제 동생은 더 이상 K-pop을 듣지 않아요. = 오랫동안 Kpop 팬이던 제 동생은 더 이상 K-pop을 듣지 않아요.

2) Event/Action Completed in the Past

지난 번에 만났던 카페에서 또 만날까요? Shall we meet again at the coffee shop we met last time?

지수 씨가 어제 노래방에서 불렀던 노래 제목이 뭐예요? What’s the name of the song that Jisoo sang at Karaoke yesterday?

정현이 생일 파티에서 입었던 드레스 좀 빌려줄 수 있어? Can I borrow the dress you wore at Junghyun’s birthday party?

이건 어제 읽었던 책이라서 다른 책을 읽고 싶어요. This is the book I read(finished) yesterday, so I want to read another one.

어제 먹었던 음식을 또 먹기 싫어요. I don’t want to eat the same food (same type of food) I had yesterday. (vs. 먹던 음식 – left over food)

All five sentences above indicate that the action was already done(finished) in the past, and does not continue now.

Considering its nature that points to past events/actions, it can be replaced with the past modifier form “Verb-ㄴ/은” without changing any particular meaning.

지난 번에 만났던 카페에서 또 만날까요? = 지난 번에 만난 카페에서 또 만날까요?

지수 씨가 어제 노래방에서 불렀던 노래 제목이 뭐예요? = 지수 씨가 어제 노래방에서 부른 노래 제목이 뭐예요?

정현이 생일 파티에서 입었던 드레스 좀 빌려줄 수 있어? = 정현이 생일 파티에서 입은 드레스 좀 빌려줄 수 있어?

이건 어제 읽었던 책이라서 다른 책을 읽고 싶어요. = 이건 어제 읽은 책이라서 다른 책을 읽고 싶어요.

어제 먹었던 음식을 또 먹기 싫어요. = 어제 먹은 음식을 또 먹기 싫어요.

Q. Are -았/었던 and -ㄴ/은 always interchangeable, then?

Not always. Depending on what verb it is, Verb-ㄴ/은 doesn’t always determine whether the action is entirely over. 

For example,

지민이가 유학간 곳은 미국이에요. (유학가다: to go study aborad)
The place Jimin went to study abroad is the U.S.

In the sentence above, we know for sure that Jimin had done the action of “going somewhere to study abroad,” but we do not know for sure whether he is still there or not.

However, if you say,

지민이가 유학갔던 곳은 미국이에요,

now we know for sure that he went to the US to study abroad, and is not there anymore.

For another example,

이건 어제 읽었던 책이라서 다른 책을 읽고 싶어요. = 이건 어제 읽은 책이라서 다른 책을 읽고 싶어요.

If you compare the two sentences, Verb-았/었던 can be replaced with Verb-ㄴ/은.

However, the other way around does not necessarily work.

Because, as previously explained, Verb-ㄴ/은 does not always indicate the “completion” of an action.

If you say 이건 어제 읽은 책이에요, it can mean one of the two things :
1) This is the book I read. (I did the action of reading. [Doesn’t necessarily mean I finished it.])
2) This is the book I finished reading. (I finished reading it.) = 내가 읽었던 책이에요.

As you can see, -ㄴ/은 does not always determine whether the action was completed or not and the focus is more on the fact that you “did” that action, whereas -았/었던 is used for actions already completed.

So if you want to make it clear that you’re referring to an action that’s already completed, it’s better to use Verb-았/었던, not Verb-ㄴ/은.

This is not something that we strictly abide by though, since many Koreans interchangeably use -았/었던 and -ㄴ/은. So please don’t worry about using it all perfectly right!

——————

Another difference between -았/었던 (or -던) and -ㄴ/은 would be that, the former can be used with both adjectives and verbs (including 이다), whereas -ㄴ/은 can only be used with verbs, and not adjectives* nor 이다.

(*When -ㄴ/은 is used with adjectives, it becomes a present-tense modifier, not past-tense.)
